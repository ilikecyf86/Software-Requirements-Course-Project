kind/epic,Workspace Loading Sequence Goal ultimate goal this specification provide fast unified loading sequence workspace inside This sequence important because want user able interact with files terminal fast possible Until interactions files terminals enabled instead being dead space important Introduce workspace main components Provide level information what being done From user perspective once interacting with workspace enabled other elements like auto completion code analyzis other tools which might requiring other agents lazy loaded second time Currently product have different sequences which perturbing users initially wanted user land only once everything ready loaded means that until workspace fully created booted user wait without being able anything loading sequence with crane animation illustrating explaining construction workspace with each pieces changed that sequence case creating workspace from dashboard flow where open show console outputs workspace startup operations have following issues that would like address with this specification inconsistent loading sequences console outputs noisy helpful user interactions blocked until everything fully loaded agents loaded after which makes loading sequence very long part this specification there various flows that have handled Access workspace from Dashboard Direct access workspace example integrated into part tool Factory sequence Chefile sequence Related issues 5144 Details Workspace elements loaded Current loading sequence There certain elements that needs loaded before user would fully ready work workspace Docker Build Image Pull This element depends workspace recipe image will always pulled until cache maybe other docker instructions will added which will require Docker Build Create container Once image there built need start create workspace machines containers Install exec agent start exec agent exec agent agent running workspace allowing instruct commands execution inside workspace runtime Install start terminal agent terminal agent that allows user terminal workspace machines defined Start tomcat agent This step could quite long download agent then starting part startup process there tomcat server which starting inside workspace machine load JARs Java classes then provides Project which basically allow user interact with project project explorer open edit files Start other configured agents workspace requiring other agents enabled those agents will executed right after agent started They will started sequentially Each agents might require dependencies downloaded installed workspace runtime Once those steps done workspace considered fully loaded ready user Identified issues current loading sequence Sequential Loading different steps executed sequentially they parallelized perfectly understandable that could have logical loading sequence with initialization workspace there could optimizations order fasten loading flow Lazy Loading Agents loaded part workspace definition there lazy loading enabled example might have enable JSON Language Server workspace configuration Agent JSON installed started even have JSON file opened This makes loading sequence heavy impact user feeling product performance Those points needs taken into account part fundamental work done 4736 loading Today load code only once user clicks open workspace which creates some unnecessary latency where displaying glowing logo need improve that behavior that code preloaded ready when user needs Starting from Dashboard Dashboard main entry point user once booted consequence able load directly when user Dashboard Starting from Chefile Factory part tool might loaded cached this case need display page user until loaded Modules activation goal this section identify different parts which activated depending loading sequence define following modules Command controller Terminal Editor Project explorer Step Docker Build Image Pull During this step workspace runtime present interations will enabled will display loading mode command controller will used show loading status terminal will shown intialization state used show loading details editor project explorer will shown loading mode Error case when workspace runtime failed build pull will possible completed outputs Step Create container During this step workspace runtime still present interations will enabled will display loading mode command controller will used show loading status terminal will shown intialization state used show loading details editor project explorer will shown loading mode Error case when workspace runtime does start Step Install exec agent start exec agent During this step workspace runtime present exec agent still necessary interact with will display loading mode command controller will used show install starting status exec agents terminal will shown intialization state used show loading details editor project explorer will shown loading mode Step Install start terminal agent During this step workspace runtime present terminal agent still necessary interact with will display loading mode command controller will used show install starting status exec agents terminal will shown starting state editor project explorer will shown loading mode Once terminal agent will enabled will visually active terminal animation display message terminal Terminal will become fully available Step Start tomcat agent During this step agent will downloaded started will display loading mode command controller will used show download progress agent dependency that also injecting terminal will activated editor project explorer will shown starting mode Once agent loaded will reveal content project explorer with animation editor will also open restore previously opened files exist open readme file nothing else defined Preloading editor will also allow initiaze orion inside Project Explorer Editor becoming fully available Step Load other agents this stage workspace available allow user interact with every parts other agents will downloaded asynchronously parallelized block user Features provided agents will enabled based loading agents example will enabled once agent will ready will allow code completion only once ready will display message autocompletion show Initializing Language Server will display loading those agents using toast displayed

kind/epic,Improve performance and usability of File Management System part functionality concentrated around file management operations most common operations performed files groups files include creating viewing editing renaming including refactoring moving copying deleting searching Folders files displayed project tree based their directory structure Current implementation some week places product this issue umbrella issue fixing those problems Replace previous implementation file watchers that used search index based inotify with scheduled file tree walking 4248 Client side resource management framework refactoring 3248 Remove redundant layer 4249 
kind/enhancement,Remove redundant VFS layer benefits that provided more actual current logic architecture There need multi tenancy support long running file system single workspace agent instance using implemented most file system items attributes facilities long user intrude file system cannot effectively file system locks provided cannot rely index update routines tracking external file system events only track events removal virtual file system layer will give following benefits Removing extra layer simplified logic less source Reuse file related libraries more reliable code Make file text searcher based file watchers make index more stable Remove synchronization required multi tenancy performance improvements general performance architecture impact investigated analyzed 
kind/enhancement,Replace previous implementation of file watchers that used for search index based on inotify with scheduled treeWalker According current logic recursively register observer every directory including projects root directory projects default eventually have many file watchers many directories have under projects location Java libraries that used those operations built Linux kernel subsystem called inotify mentioned subsystem default limits inotify watchers around 128k which means that track more than 128k directories This number distributed among kernel users according existing reports limit being exceeded quite often This leads malfunction file watching subsystem rare cases even inability start workspace Previously attempt overcome those impediments made result those efforts dynamic file watching system which excels ability flexibly manage resources frees inotify limit However this approach limitations order dynamically watch unwatch directories files have know exactly what observe location name addition designed accurately track moderate amount comparing project size file system items Obviously track directories project will have same resource problem that with previous implementation would okay there were real requirements track whole project folder state track files what here make hybrid file watching system will have dynamic file watchers that will provide near real time responses less than second track file system items short range along with that will also have static file watchers system that will have moderate response time several seconds track whole file tree under root project directory Words dynamic static used context resource management seems good idea taking into account ratio complexity effectivity file tree walking facilities periodically recursively update memory project structures initial implementation Though free walk frequency performance such approach topic separate discussion along with alternatives according preliminary analysis this approach should requirements quite well

kind/epic,Eclipse Che CLI Refactoring Improvements This epic covers number improvements refactor Allow offline installation mode Eliminate duplicate code between server launcher Simplify management dependent containers Allow custom assemblies products like OpenShift Codenvy reuse extend Move utility containers from eclipse dockerfiles eclipse repository Port ARTIK make improved configuration management installations Support docker compose orchestrator Provide multipe orchestrator launch mechanisms with single configuration Simplify configuration into environment variables Provide backup restore functionality work this epic refactoring branch order specification below indicates order work done Consolidation want consolidate CLIs that exist between Codenvy move meaningful functionality into Most this work already been captured refactoring branch elements this work Support init download config start stop restart destroy offline Configure server docker container docker compose script template that provided have server logs machine logs written instance config folder This would identical that Codenvy does ensuring that folder mounts various orchestrators done proper support backupandche restore match cross platform backup recovery capabilities that reflected Codenvy Migrate existing function compile mount test into will migrating profile into That will Perform another refactoring create updated versions eclipse launcher codenvy launcher which provide important functions start restart stop config init version backup restore upgrade offline download This will move heft into single container then make optional wrapper This also affect longer requiring docker compose host provide that client container Specification details bottom Need test workspace logs written disk sync commands Specialized Testing Codenvy have been tested aggressively against systems that have boot2docker think will likely break There number situations where write perform tests current directory should either just fail with error message what change should detect boot2docker override CHE_CONFIG CHE_INSTANCE local directory activities into userprofile Verify that will work windows with CHE_CONFIG CHE_INSTANCE paths that have dots spaces their path name Work with original poster migrate imrpovements from 2921 that this configurability supported with merge this point then make more improvements Dockerfile Management want move stack images into repository into dockerfiles directory This also includes folder which important utilities moving these images into repository code images keep them consistent with releases There will number improvements make Have folders with dockerfiles folder name instead dockerfiles will move core Dockerfiles Dockerfile centos into dockerfiles This will require updating Dockerfile make sure assembly referenced right location also moving assembly docker into this dockerfiles folder with entrypoint name Each dockerfiles directory should have singular build which will create image such eclipse need update comments Dockerfile each image that build instructions accurate Update systems that images built pushed using these images instead ones dockerfiles should move files that COPY into image subdirectory Dockerfile directory example dockerfiles version folder will have Dockerfile entrypoint image would then move version folder which files that packaged into that image This would also mean that might modify assembly assembly main generate assemblies only target also place copy into dockerfiles well since that image requires assembly Clean docs only reference this approach would still document launcher server approach would eliminate usage Vagrant merge this point then make more improvements Create Custom each Assembly Port eclipse ARTIK Port codenvy Codenvy SAAS codenvy codenvy 1340 merge this point then make more improvements Improve format configuration management There file which single point configuration should extend properties files allow more environmental configuration cover full range customizations that possible example Codenvy allows customizing private docker registries with this format this capability here Similar docker compose should also generate each instance bash script that will launcher without using docker compose Eliminate functional redundancies have some places same function bash repeated four places launcher server entrypoint codenvy Yuck yuck yuck further complicated fact that have separation files which necessary that self updating want move common functions into dockerfiles file then need automate generation scripts that depend upon these common functions common functions cannot source because needs embed functions within file sent customers will need generate codenvy example which sources functions needs adds them into file below line that should never modified will then need test server launcher Codenvy then need build have Assemblies which allows different products reuse certain parts without having have duplicate methods While some cases there identical functions that placed into there also similar methods which duplicates such cmd_start which mostly same somewhat different will want move this into abstraction general pupose method which reusable extensible same time Tyler will work with engineer show examples this system should allow base abstraction updated immediately reusable that wants clone reuse extend Tomcat startup script number Docker related checks which longer required should remove these checks optimize script only support starting Tomcat should possile start Tomcat without assuming Docker requirements will supporting localhost machines alongsize docker machines After docs finished retag eclipse eclipse When this then remove evidence eclipse launcher from docs DockerHub

kind/bug,Some commands that have worked through bash shell can work wrong regression Reproduction Steps After setup default shell Codenvy some commands that saved early will wrong example some workspace used command like echo some text check check Expected behavior After execution command should created check file with next content some text check Observed behavior content file will like some text check flag will added into file This problem many unexpected results commands that were saved workspaces created earlier same problem factories which bash commands Many users puzzled version SNAPSHOT version Ubuntu Docker version install Docker container
