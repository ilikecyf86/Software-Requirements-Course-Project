We will replace with old terminal UI based on term.js to UI based on xterm.js. This epic consists of steps: Investigate correct working xtermjs with requirejs #3517. Integration xterm.js to GWT code. #3525 Improve xterm.js css styles to nice view. #3526 Improve build xterm js using gulp tasks.We need it because native build based on bash script and this platform dependent solution. Gulp tasks is platform independent and we had already used this tool for user dashboard. Also we can contribute gulp build to xterm.js, because community is thinking about using this tool. #3527 Fix losing text selection: #3757. This is not bug of the xterm.js. This bug of the code integration. Pass QA cycle.
