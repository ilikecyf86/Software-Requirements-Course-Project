From @skryzhny on May 19, 2017 7:29 As per problem described in #2199 we may implement additional enhancement: squash layers when snapshotting containers. For frequently changed big files, like appending logs this may greatly help in reducing snapshot's image size and thus download/startup time. Reproduction Steps: Same as in #2199 Codenvy version: 5.10.0-SaaS Copied from original issue: codenvy/codenvy#2218
