Dashboard is not able to cache factories

Dashboard fetches factories each time instead of using cache with etag like he does with entities on other pages. Reproduction Steps: Create at least one factory in che. Open factories page on dashboard and check requests list Expected: First request returns 200 response code and next requests return 304. Actual: All requests returns 200. It works in this way because of wrong accepted rel that contains hash of GuiceUriBuilderImpl instance instead of link. {
