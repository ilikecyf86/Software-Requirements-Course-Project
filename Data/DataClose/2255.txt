Docker Store - Replace Che-Server Base Image
kind/enhancement 
The vulnerabilities we got on our security scan from the Docker store are also in the openjdk/alpine image. Need to change our che-server base Docker "alpine" image to "openjdk/alpine" image. This should allow us to have Docker coordinate with openjdk directly to solve issue. This is in reference to #2534.
