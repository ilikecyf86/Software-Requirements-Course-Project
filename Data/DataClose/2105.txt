Simplify flows when creating a workspace
kind/enhancement team/plugin 
We are currently having the ability for a user to create a workspace and define the workspace runtime definition at the same time. The experience is not efficient for various reasons: Defining the runtime needs the user to go into the "Runtimes" tabs While we provide the ability to edit the recipe, we should show correct error messages about the syntax that we are supporting The flow to configure the different machines is There is no capabilities to test the runtime We are about to merge a better experience, dedicated to the creation of stacks #2316 + add a new stack library widget #2971. In order to simplify the usability of the creation workspace flow, we will do the following improvements: Remove the ability create a workspace from a custom stack Remove ability to use a recipe from a URL Add button to "Add Stack" which will redirect to #2971 screens Restyle label container in dashboard #3212 Restyle input field in dashboard #3213 Create spinner widget #3214 Create widget for displaying advanced filter #3392
