Allow removing the SVN support by simply removing the Subversion plugins from the assembly
kind/task 
Currently, the The SubversionCredentialsDialog interface is injected into the standard project wizard (through constructor), to be used by the Subversion support. When the Subversion plugins are removed from a customized assembly, the GWT build fails in assembly-ide-war, because no SubversionCredentialsDialog implementation is found to be injected into the project wizard class. We should remove this requirement, to allow dropping the Suversion support in customized assemblies more easily.
