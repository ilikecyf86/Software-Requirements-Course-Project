Close workspace with snapshot still lost data stored in container volume
kind/question 
Create a stack with a custom docker image. The image expose a volume. Open the workspace from the stack. A container is started by workspace and a volume is mount on host. e.g: var/lib/docker/volumes/da486eeb2b4d8652c5cae5301e80374173d0137dd8151d13377b4cb2a2fa8a5d/_data" Stop workspace with snapshot and open it again Che will assign another volume for the container. So all data stored in previous volume lost. Che does not support specify volume in stack recipe, so every time a workspace startup, a random volume will be bind to container, the data stored in that volume can not be persisted. Is it possible to always use same volume to start container if workspace is closed with snapshot? Or have methods to specify volume of container for workspace?
