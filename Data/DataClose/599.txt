In SPI branch OpenShift infrastructure only support recipes of type openshift but we want users to be able start workpace on OpenShift based on a dockerimage recipes too. A first implementation of the dockerimage recipe support has been made in the OpenShiftConnector. This issue is about deprecating OpenShiftConnector and porting its logic in the new SPI based OpenShift Infrastructure.
