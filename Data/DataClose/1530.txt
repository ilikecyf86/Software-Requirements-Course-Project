I have added custom project types into the samples.json file. I have also configure git on the host machine to avoid ssl verification by the command git config --global http.sslVerify false. When I try to create a custom project (one from the samples.json list) it returns an error https://github.com/BlahBlah/Demo.git: cannot open git-upload-pack OS and version: Ubuntu 16.04
