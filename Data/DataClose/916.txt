Assembly Dev Lifecycle - Production Mode (Windows 10)
kind/question 
Hello, I tried to deploy a custom CHE 5.10.0 binaries in production mode following this guide. As it is said in the guide, I created a folder dockerfiles with the following folders/files in my CHE assembly repo (taken from here): I then executed the build.sh script in each folder but each time I got this error: Building Docker Image .../...-cli:nightly from /c/Users/.../dockerfiles/cli directory with tag nightly time="2017-06-01T15:53:08+02:00" level=info msg="Unable to use system certificate pool: crypto/x509: system root pool is not available on Windows" unable to prepare context: unable to evaluate symlinks in Dockerfile path: GetFileAttributesEx C:\c: Le fichier spécifié est introuvable. (=The system cannot find the file specified.) Build of .../...cli:nightly [OK] Script run successfully: .../...-cli:nightly I use Windows 10 and I run the build.sh scripts with Docker Quickstart Terminal (=Docker Toolbox). It seems like other people have a similar same problem but I checked and there is not the .txt extension in the filenames of the Dockerfile files.
