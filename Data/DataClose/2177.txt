import eclipse based on maven build has compat issues
kind/task team/ide 
maven projects have a different structure than eclipse che expects and therefore it fails... Reproduction Steps: clone any maven based project from eclipse or any maven based project that was built with the eclipse IDE you would expect that eclipse che can create a build based on the pom.xml file however eclipse che expects the parent pom to be in the root of the git repo with eclipse ide that is literally not possible -> you can only edit files within projects so parent pom is a seperate project next to the child maven projects that requires a lot of manual step on each project to convert it to a project **Che version: 5.0.M6 *_OS and version:Mac OS X El Capitan *_Docker version:1.12.1 Che install: [Vagrant, Docker container, server (zip), Bitnami, Yatta, or Codenvy?]
