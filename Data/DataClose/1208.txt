We have unexpected regress for CHE integration test since 03.03.2017. This is next jobs: https://ci.codenvycorp.com/view/qa/job/che-integration-tests/286/ https://ci.codenvycorp.com/view/qa/job/che-integration-tests/285/ com.codenvy.ide.plugins.testrunner com.codenvy.ide.intelligencecommand com.codenvy.ide.codeserver com.codenvy.ide.filewatcher com.codenvy.ide.debugger Also we have unexpected error like: java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: Workspace ShowFileRefered406 with expected status has not been found. It means that the workspace has not been created correctly. But more details are not received with test in log. We have issue for this: https://github.com/codenvy/qa/issues/664. We should resolve 2 problems: Unexpected skipping of tests Unexpected stopping workspaces with error It is very critical. Because data from CI use all developers for analize of regression.
