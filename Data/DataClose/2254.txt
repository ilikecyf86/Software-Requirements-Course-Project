Command editor should allow multi-line commands to be typed without using &&
kind/enhancement 
Today we allow people to create multi-line commands by either: Adding "&&" between commands on a single line in the command editor. Creating a multiline command outside the command editor and pasting it in. There is no ability to add a return in the command editor itself. It would be better to allow Shift-Enter to be used for a return and Enter to accept the dialog.
