Redesigned experience for managing workspaces
kind/epic team/plugin 
Goals In the past, we have unified the flows to create and edit workspaces, but it added more usability challenges to the end-user than the benefits. We also introduced the multi-machines workspaces which also complexified the usability of the Dashboard when it's time to configure a workspace. The goals of this epic is to improve the user experience around creating workspaces from Dashboard and managing them. We will also rethink the loading experience and the transitions between the Dashboard and the browser IDE. Details Create Workspace flow: The idea is to provided a guided flow for the user when he has to create a workspace. We'll use this flow consistently in the dashboard to allow the creation of workspace (either it's a team workspace, or the first screen displayed to the user when starting Che). Workspace Details: We will revisit most of the forms which allow to configure a workspace. We will improve agents management + multi-machine handling Loading Sequence Replace crane loader when accepting a factory Analyze outputs of agents to display only relevant information to end-user (still allowing to get complete outputs) Provide a better loading sequence of workspaces in the IDE Mockups Create workspace (the widget at the bottom is showing the "Add Project" popover.) Workspace details Here the goal is really to simplify the workspace details screens - especially the "Runtime" tab. We will split the various configuration items of the workspace into multiple tabs. Please Note that for now, we will just rename "Workspace Config" to "RAW Config". Workspace Overview Note: In the future, we can add more information into the "Overview" in order to summarize what's defined in the other tabs.
