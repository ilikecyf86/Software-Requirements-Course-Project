@riuvshin has recently created a CI job to verify rh-che build against eclipe/che master branch HEAD. Here are some possible improvements: Build che server image eclipse/che-server:nightly-centos-rhche using the artifact built by rh-che build and Dockerfile.centos (I think that we don't need to push the image to the docker hub for now). Start OpenShift in a Docker container, deploy Che there and verify that Che is started and accessible - codenvy/infrastructure#133 Run a simple test (e.g. create a new workspace using the vert.x stack and verify that terminal and wsagent services are started successfully)
