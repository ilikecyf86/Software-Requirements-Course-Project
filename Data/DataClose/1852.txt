Workspace doesn't startup
kind/bug kind/question kind/bug 
My workspace is stuck on start up and log displays 2016-12-28 08:49:54,279[ost-startStop-1]  [WARN ] [e.c.p.m.s.c.c.ClasspathManager 87]   - Maven server not started looks like you don't have Maven in your path
 This issues seems to be linked directly to the content of my projects directory, last time I thought it was because I created a symlink but when I did some tests the issue left and today again but I have no symlink. I removed a backup folder of a project and everything came as normal... I tried to start the workspace 4 times before removing the folder. And my workspace is reset too. The project folder seems really sensitive and can block the startup of a workspace without giving any information about it. Reproduction Steps: Add a folder into project directory without passing by interface, via shell Shutdown the workspace and the Che server Start Che Server and workspace Expected behavior: Workspace starts without issue Observed behavior: Workspace gives timeout on boot At that Log moment => 2016-12-28 08:49:54,279[ost-startStop-1] [WARN ] [e.c.p.m.s.c.c.ClasspathManager 87] - Maven server not started looks like you don't have Maven in your path Che version: 5.0.0-M8 OS and version: Win7 + Boot2Docker 1.12.4 Docker version: Docker version 1.12.3 Che install: Docker container **Additional information: na Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: Yes (but not sure) Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes
