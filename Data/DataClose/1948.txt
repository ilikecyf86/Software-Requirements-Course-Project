Workspaces disappear from interface after a stop/crash
kind/question 
First thank you for all that awesome work you do !! The problem : Anytime the system doesn't close correctly, my workspaces disappear from interface. I use windows with Boot2Docker. And I use Docker Launcher. When the VM shutdown correctly, respecting the rules, everything is fine. But when the VM crash or is terminated brutally, the workspaces are not there anymore... Everything is reset. Anytime the system crash, I need to run <docker rm -f che-server>, which seems normal because the server didn't exit normally. When I access to my VM, it seems that the folder "/home/user/che/workspace" is not bind/mount anymore. But in docker, the workspaces are still there. Is there a command to get them back ? Reproduction Steps: Start che-server and prepare a workspace Stop the OS without any command (just close) <docker rm -f che-server> and start che-server Expected behavior: Workspace still there Observed behavior: No more workspace Che version: 5.0.0-latest OS and version: Win7 + Boot2Docker Docker version: Version: 1.12.3 Che install: Docker container Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: I Don't know Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: No
