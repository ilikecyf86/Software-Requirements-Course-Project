kind/bug severity/blocker team/enterprise severity/P1 severity/blocker selenium/failure 
Reproduction Steps: Start Che with environment property CHE_DOCKER_PRIVILEGED=false. Create CPP workspace with C++ project. Make C++ project and start gdbserver to debug this project by the command: cd ${current.project.path} && make && gdbserver :8001 ./a.out After that there is error message was displayed in command panel: gdbserver: linux_ptrace_test_ret_to_nx: Cannot PTRACE_TRACME: Operation not permited gdbserver: linux_ptrace_test_ret_to_nx: status 256 is not WIFSTOPPED! At the same time gdbserver started correctly when Che had environment property CHE_DOCKER_PRIVILEGED=true. OS and version: Ubuntu 16.06, Fedora, Linux Mint 18 Eclipse Che ver. 5.6.0-SNAPSHOT At the same time in Ubuntu 14.04 gdbserver works correctly. Selenium tests: there is test CppProjectDebuggingTest.shouldDebugCppProject() which should be enabled after this issue has been fixed.
