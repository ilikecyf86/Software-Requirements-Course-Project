kind/enhancement sprint/next-sprint team/ide sprint/next-sprint 
We need to gracefully help users configure the electron client and how it interacts with the outside world. The items of configuration that a user may need to configure could be done in a local configuration file, or perhaps as part of the onboarding GUI in a preferences window. The configuration items include: CHE_HOST / ARTIK_HOST / CODENVY_HOST Local Only: CHE_PORT / ARTIK_PORT Proxy Config: ALL_PROXY, HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY (test conn to dockerhub) Config property for stopping client: stop all remote workspaces? yes / no Config property for stopping client: stop local che server? yes / no Default onboarding flow (local, remote)? --- skips onboarding screens
