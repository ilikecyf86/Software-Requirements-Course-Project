Refactor exec + terminal agent to separate components needed for: commons(place for utilities and structures like FileLogger) commands execution(execute cmd + subscriber interface for logs consumption) authentication transport REST(routing + request handling) WS + JSONRPC engine(routing + request handling + channel management) etc. It should be possible to create new agent that can reuse these components.
