Che Factory api
kind/question 
Am trying to retrieve factory info (list of factories - json which contains detailed info on all available factories) using che factory api. The GET api /factory/find is based on name as an attribute and using this i could see one factory object - http://machinename:8080/api/factory/find?name=sampleF1 How do i use get API to list all the factories - irrespective of name/creator name ?
