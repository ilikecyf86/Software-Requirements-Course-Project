Git commit window needs to be improved. Proposal of the new Git commit window view: Commit will be performed for files that are marked with the help of check-boxes. 'delete' button will remove the selected file 'reset index' button will revert changes in selected file double click on item will show 'git compare' window Important! : For now we do not have possibility to paste check-boxes in tree widget, so we can have only a list of changed files with check boxes. 'Group by directory' button will not be implemented.
