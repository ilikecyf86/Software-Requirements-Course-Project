Che uses JGit, and there's Git installed in a workspace. These two gits do not share user SSH keys that are stored in user prefs (/api/preferences). It becomes quite confusing for users who, having uploaded ssh keys using UI Git, expect these keys to be available for a console git in a terminal. Proposed solution: When a workspace starts get user keys from /api/preferences and inject them in a workspace Let a user choose if or not it should happen on workspace start since this might be a security issue - when a workspace is shared with another user, such a user has access to ssh keys. It may be a check box in user dashboard for example.
