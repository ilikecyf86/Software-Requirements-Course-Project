Getting Started CHE CLI: che.sh fails to download cli.sh
kind/question 
che.sh seems to have a problem with the command docker run --rm --net=host appropriate/curl "$@" which is evaluated when you run che start like in the reproduction steps. I tried that command manually without all the curl silent flags docker run --rm --net=host appropriate/curl --head --fail https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/che/master/cli.sh to get more information, and the output was: curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host 'raw.githubusercontent.com'
 I ran it multiple times with the same result, meanwhile I was able to access raw.githubusercontent.com... from my PC and running my locally installed curl succeeds so the problem seems to be running curl from this docker container. Reproduction Steps: Follow the Getting started guide for windows. Error appears when you run che start. Observed behavior: Output: CLI download error. Bad network or version. CLI update works for 5.0.0-M3+. OS and version: Window 10 Pro Docker version: 1.12.3 (The native windows version)
