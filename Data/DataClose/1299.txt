Files and projects management in Eclipse Che
kind/question 
Hi ! I want to create a che extension that generates a multi-modules Enterprise applications (using maven archetype) from UML models. In order to do that the extensions need to create and modify a large set of files, so I was wondering: How can Che manage to recognize and watch physical files created by my maven plugins in the file system ? How could we create a new project type extending maven project archetypes ? If you could provide any example or a tutorial helping to understand those Che mechanisms. Note that I'm student and I'm developing extensions for Che As part of my final project internship so any help is largely appreciated, Thanks.
