che.sh + docker: IPs and ws-agent timeouts
kind/question 
First time running Che locally, I'm using the che start launcher. The first workspace I started, '.NET stack' with 'aspnet-web-simple' had a dialog "Workspace Connection Error" and continuous error popups "Connection failed with terminal" in the editor. There are browser console errors timing out on to an IP that's on the docker0 Ubuntu network, which an external machine's browser can't see. The dialog suggested customizing che-server's "--remote", but links to a README that only talks about environment variables for che-launcher, which che start uses indirectly. "Maven server not started looks like you don't have Maven in your path" - not relevant. Reproduction Steps: What I've done so far... I installed Ubuntu 16.01 on a clean VM (VirtualBox in Windows 10) Made it a 'bridged network' so I can connect to it from host/home network I'm running commands inside the VM on a terminal. I'm not using docker-machine or anything. sudo apt-get install docker.io, added myself to docker group, etc until docker run hello-world works From [https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/che-getting-started]: mkdir ~/bin
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/che/master/che.sh > ~/bin/che
chmod +x ~/bin/che
 che start, wait until "Booted and reachable" Use che (from the PC hosting the VM, not inside the VM) at [vm's hostname]:8080. Made a new workspace with the ".NET" stack and the "aspnet-web-simple" template. Errors start at "Starting workspace agent". (See discussion for later attempts using CHE_HOST_IP and nightly) Expected behavior: The workspace starts without errors... If Maven is a dependency... - Not relevant. Observed behavior: "New Workspace" screen stops at "Starting Workspace Agent". che-dotnet-workspace-log.txt "Workspace Connection Error" dialog pops up a bit later talking about '--remote:', not sure if it's relevant? The browser using Che is outside the VM, but the workspace containers are in the same Docker daemon as Che. The configuration readme linked doesn't mention "--remote" directly at all. The workspace appears to have been created, but nothing's working right when opening it: "Starting workspace agent" takes forever, repeated popups "Connection failed with terminal". If I use the .NET stack in 'codenvy beta', none of these problems happen. Che version: Whatever today's che.sh downloaded: codenvy/che-server:latest 81c28128c057 "6 weeks ago" (See discussion for later attempts using nightly) codenvy/che-launcher:nightly 8d79343ce840 "4 weeks ago" codenvy/dotnet_core:latest 8bb4970ceaba "10 weeks ago" OS and version: Ubuntu Desktop 16.01 as a VirtualBox VM on Windows 10 Docker version: 1.12.1, client and server Che install: Docker. Additional information: Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: No clue, first used the launcher today. If I use the same stack in 'codenvy beta', it works fine. Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Investigating.
