No syntax highlighting for Groovy files
kind/bug kind/enhancement team/ide kind/bug 
Hi there, I started to play around with Eclipse Che after finding the link to Codenvy in the documentation of vert.x. I used the docker image to setup my own instance Version: 5.0.0-M8 Revision: 1c15a44 Build Time: 2016-12-07 12:51:44 When trying to work on Groovy source files the syntax-highlighting is missing. The status bar tells "text/x-groovy", when working on a Java-file it just tells "Java" and the highlighting is fine. Also JavaScript ("JavaScript") and Ruby ("text/x-ruby") work fine. Am I missing something in the configuration? I use UTF-8 encoding. I'd be happy to use Eclipse Che with our Team as an alternative to administer local eclipse install on n developer machines. As we would mainly use it as a Groovy Source Code Editor, Eclipse Che might be a good opportunity for us. @TylerJewell of @codenvy asked me to open that issue. Thanks for developing this great project. Let me know if I can help you. Take care greetings from sunny but cold Germany Andreas Reproduction Steps: Open a Groovy file Check if there is syntax highlighting Check the information in the editor status line Expected behavior: Source code is rendered with syntax highlighting Observed behavior: Source Code is shown in plain ASCII without highlighting Che version: 5.0.0-M8 OS and version: Linux a59ec30b29c6 4.4.39-moby #1 SMP Fri Dec 16 07:34:12 UTC 2016 x86_64 Linux Docker version: Client: Version: 1.12.5 API version: 1.24 Go version: go1.6.4 Git commit: 7392c3b Built: Fri Dec 16 06:14:34 2016 OS/Arch: windows/amd64 Server: Version: 1.12.5 API version: 1.24 Go version: go1.6.4 Git commit: 7392c3b Built: Fri Dec 16 06:14:34 2016 OS/Arch: linux/amd64 Che install: Docker image as stated in Start Che with Docker curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/che/master/che.sh > che.sh curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/che/master/che.bat > che.bat che start Additional information: Just worked with this version and it has happened from the start Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes
