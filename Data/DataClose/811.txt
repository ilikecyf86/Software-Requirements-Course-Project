What's a runtime?
kind/question 
Hi, I am currently reading the Docs again and i am having a little trouble to understand what the word runtime is supposed to mean. There is the following paragraph in the "Runtime Recipes" section which confuses me: Workspaces can have a single runtime or multiple runtimes. Che uses Docker, though Che could handle runtimes other than Docker, to create runtime(s) from Dockerfiles for a single-container runtime, or compose files to create single-container/multi-container runtime(s). "Che could handle runtimes other than Docker" suggests that Docker itself is the runtime, but the next part ("to create runtime(s) from Dockerfiles") tells me, that i am creating runtimes with Dockerfiles/Composefiles. From my understanding, Dockerfiles create Runtime-Machines not the runtimes itself. What is a runtime in this context? Thank you.
