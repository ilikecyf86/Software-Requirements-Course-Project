To allow clients make a load of workspace more smooth and provide a feeling that it starts faster we should allow retrieving of the current state of runtime while it is in starting state. Goal: Rework WorkspaceRuntimes and WorkspaceManager - Workspace runtime should be available during workspace start Revise methods WorkspaceManager.removeWorkspace an DockerAbandonedResourcesCleaner.cleanNetworks . Now we have assumptions that WorkspaceRuntimes.hasRuntime true if a workspace is running. After 1. it wouldn't be true.
