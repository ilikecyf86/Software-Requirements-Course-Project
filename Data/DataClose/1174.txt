We track file operations here https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/wsagent/che-core-api-project/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/vfs/impl/file/event/detectors/EditorFileTracker.java#L66-66 But in some cases EditorFileTracker does not receive these operations call from client. For example, we receive SUSPEND -> MOVE -> RESUME events when rename java class and project tree node is selected, but does not when project tree node is not selected(a name of class is selected at this case). It leads to some bugs on server side. Reproduction Steps: Open some class in a java project. Select a class name. Assistant -> Refactoring -> Rename Set new class name The same bug for Assistant -> Refactoring -> Move action
