kind/bug severity/P1 status/in-progress team/enterprise status/code-review status/in-progress status/code-review 
Reproduction Steps: Run dockerized CHE, create and run new workspace, create project inside workspace. Stop workspace. Remove workspace. Open folders ~/che/data/instance/data/workspaces/ , ( "~/che" this is default location, if you set another place you should correct path). Actual result: Deleted workspace folder with created project still exists inside "workspaces". Expected result: "workspaces" folder should not contains data with deleted workspaces. OS and version: Ubuntu 16.04 and Fedora 24 CHE version: 5.2.0-SNAPSHOT
