We decided to put git branch name next to project name in project explorer panel. At the time we have a maven module name there. If we put the git brunch name next to maven module name it may be visually overwhelming for some users, but very useful to another ones. I propose: make it possible to turn off/on a maven module name in the user preference menu. displaying a maven module name should be off by default.
