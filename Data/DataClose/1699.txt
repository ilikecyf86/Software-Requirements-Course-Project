Workspace container exposed to IP 0.0.0.0 instead of CHE_HOST
kind/question 
Running che via nightly docker cli, the server starts up OK and asks to create its first workspace. The workspace is created OK, but you can see with "docker ps" that its ports are exposed to 0.0.0.0 instead of the IP specified in environment variable CHE_HOST. During the "Starting Workspace Agent" stage, the server cannot contact the workspace and complains with an error "Client has aborted connection" in the log window and "Workspace Connection Error" window on the page. If I stop the workspace and start it again, it starts again but the server still cannot reach it. Reproduction Steps: Start Che in a new data space. I use: docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /home/me/che-data:/data -e CHE_HOST=10.2.4.1 -e CHE_PORT=8085 eclipse/che:nightly start Create new workspace. Notice that the workspace cannot be reached by the server. Che version: latest nightly - is that 5.1.0 ?? OS and version: Ubuntu 14.04 (also tested on 16.04) Docker version: 1.12.5 Che cli.log output: Attached cli.zip
