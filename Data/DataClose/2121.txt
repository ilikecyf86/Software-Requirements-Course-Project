Ctrl-P, Ctrl-N, Tab are working same as typical consoles, but Ctrl-A doesn't. Reproduction Steps: Forus in Teiminal tab Type something. Press Ctrl-A Expected behavior: The cursor moves. Observed behavior: All regions are selected. Che version: 5.0.0-M7-SNAPSHOT b3ef0a2 OS and version: Probably no dependency. Docker version: Probably no dependency. Che install: Docker container Additional information: It seems there have no key binding information in menus. So I can't determine that this is a specification or a bug. Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: Unchecked Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes
