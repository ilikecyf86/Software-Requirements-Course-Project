"Reading Project Structure" popup long and painful
kind/bug 
Hi, Again thanks for this project, the last update 5.0.0M8 was the best. The last thing, in my case, would be to remove or run in bg this "reading project structure" any time we add/remove/rename a file in the Code Editor. I am not sure if I am in the right Repo to post this issue. This popup will come everytime and stop the access to the interface for 30 sec each time or more sometimes. Reproduction Steps: Create a project and access the workspace Create a folder Expected behavior: (If the reading wasn't existing) See my folder appeared and continue to dev Observed behavior: Stuck for 30+sec, see my folder appeared, stuck for 30sec and come back to dev. And sometimes the tree doesn't even refresh... Che version: 5.0.0M8 OS and version: Boot2Docker + windows 7 Docker version: 1.12.3 Che install: Docker container Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: test Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: No/Yes
