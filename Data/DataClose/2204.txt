SVN UI - Commands Run via Java Implementation

Enhancement request. Referencing issue #2852 . Currently, the subversion UI uses the dev-machine to issue svn commands which requires subversion to be installed on dev-machine and credentials to be entered in each workspace. However, git commands are issued through java and does not depend on the dev-machine to issue commands. We could look at using https://subversion.apache.org/docs/javahl/latest/ for a svn java implementation. This would need to be added to the ws-agent or a separate svn agent. We need to give the user the ability to enter the credentials but also allow for the credentials to be modified since there would be no way currently for the user to do this since the svn commands would not be run through the dev-machine/workspace. Expected behavior: Svn UI commands to run with java library. Credentials for svn to be stored in user profile in che-server database. Ability to remove existing credentials if they exists and provide new credentials via UI. Observed behavior: Svn UI commands are run through dev-machine. Credentials are stored in dev-machine. Dev-machine needs to have svn installed.
