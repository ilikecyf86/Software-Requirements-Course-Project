Hello I am unable to upgrade my eclipse che version from 5.6.0 to 5.7.1. When upgrading, che give me this error : ERROR: che is running. Stop before performing an upgrade. However no container are running (docker ps return no line). Reproduction Steps: From my terminal I ran this command: docker ps to ensure that no container are running.
