Windows boot2docker fails starting new che-server under certain conditions
kind/bug severity/blocker 
Windows with boot2docker. Have %userprofile% be a directory with a space in the path. set CHE_VERSION=nightly set CHE_UTILITY_VERSION=nightly The che-server does not configure the embedded che.properties properly. The template should be copied into a /conf folder so that paths for the terminal and agents can be configured. But the che-server doesn't properly detect boot2docker and ends up setting the template folder to the wrong place. This is the execution from the CLI - and youc an see that the che-launcher is correct. So eclipse/che-server is not handling the parameter well. WARN: Boot2docker for Windows - CHE_DATA_FOLDER set to /c/Users/Valued Customer/.che
