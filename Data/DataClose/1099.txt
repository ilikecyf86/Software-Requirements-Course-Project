Non-DevMachine information through macros
kind/enhancement team/ide 
Working on converting a multi-machine project from production to a workspace recipe I was not able to effectively reference exposed port number of machines other than dev-machine. This was a pretty big problem for me (and other users) as there were client side calls to other containers that needed to be made. Currently I have to manually set the ephemeral ports assigned to these machine's exposed port manually in a configuration file in the projects folder. Below is a proposed solution. Macro Details ${machine.<name>.<port>} Returns protocol, hostname and port of an internal server for a machine named <name>. is defined by the same internal port of the internal service that you have exposed in your workspace recipe. ${machine.<name>.<port>.protocol} Returns protocol of a server registered by name for a machine named <name> ${machine.<name>.<port>.hostname} Returns hostname of a server registered by name for a machine named <name> ${machine.<name>.port.<port>} Returns the hostname and port of a service or application you launch for a machine named <name> . Example: ${machine.db.<port>} for the petclinic project using the java mysql stack would return the protocol, hostname and port of the workspace machine db not dev-machine. Codenvy 5.8.1
