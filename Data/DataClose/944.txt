New workspace get breakpoints from previous workspace

When creating a new workspace, with a project already setup in another workspace, the breakpoints are automatically set in the new workspace. See discussion in #5116. Reproduction Steps: I created a workspace and imported a project. Use the debugger and setup a breakpoint. I stop workspace and delete it. Then: I created another workspace (with a different name) and import the same project. When I opened the file where I previously setup a breakpoint in the previous workspace, I was having the same breakpoint displayed back into this newly created workspace. See attached gif:
