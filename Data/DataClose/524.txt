LanguageServerLauncherTemplate waits 5 seconds even if unneccesary

In the implementation of LanguageServerLauncherTemplate#waitCheckProcess, there is a fixed 5 second wait. This wait should be extended (it's not always enought for jdt.ls, for example) and early return implemented when the process is ready. I have implemented the fix in a branch and will cherry pick to a PR when convenient.
