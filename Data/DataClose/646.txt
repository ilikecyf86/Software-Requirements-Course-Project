Problem to install Eclipse Che on Windows Server 2016 : "image operating system "linux" cannot be used on this platform"
kind/question 
Hello, We plan to migrate to Eclipse Che and we would like evaluate the IDE "Next Generation" for a specific project for one of our clients. they use only Windows Server OS, so I'd tried to configure a sandbox server with Eclipse Che. On Windows Server 2016, once Docker installed, an error occured just after PS> docker run -it eclipse/che start Unable to find image 'eclipse/che:latest' locally latest: Pulling from eclipse/che C:\Program Files\Docker\docker.exe: image operating system "linux" cannot be used on this platform. See 'C:\Program Files\Docker\docker.exe run --help'. PS> Windows Server 2016 Standard 32 Gb / 16 proc Inten Xeon 2,3Ghz I had checked the Docker installation with success : docker run hello-world:nanoserver (ok) docker run microsoft/dotnet-samples:dotnetapp-nanoserver (ok) It's seems to me that Eclipse Che shoud be worked on Windows? Many thanks for your help Bruno
