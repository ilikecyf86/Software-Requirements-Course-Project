Eclipse Che start fails due to some connection issues
kind/question 
I am new to Eclipse Che and am attempting to start Che on a local machine. I am running the latest version (v5.2.2?) under Docker v1.13. I have followed the instructions for a local install provided at https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/setup/getting-started/index.html I successfully installed Docker and was able to start up Che using the following command: sudo docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /home/tstuser/software/docker:/data eclipse/che start Note that I did not edit anything in the configuration (I didn't know about that yet). I just installed Docker and attempted the Che startup. Unfortunately, my attempt to start yielded the following result: WARN: Bound 'eclipse/che' to 'eclipse/che:5.2.2' WARNING: bridge-nf-call-iptables is disabled WARNING: bridge-nf-call-ip6tables is disabled INFO: (che cli): 5.2.2 - using docker 1.13.0 / native INFO: (che config): Generating che configuration... INFO: (che config): Customizing docker-compose for running in a container INFO: (che start): Preflight checks WARNING: bridge-nf-call-iptables is disabled WARNING: bridge-nf-call-ip6tables is disabled mem (1.5 GiB): [OK] disk (100 MB): [OK] port 8080 (http): [AVAILABLE] conn (browser => ws): [NOT OK] conn (server => ws): [NOT OK] ERROR: Try 'docker run eclipse/che info --network' for more tests. Since the failure did not give ay substantive information, I did as the above error message suggested: sudo docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /home/tstuser/software/docker:/data eclipse/che info --network This yielded the following: WARN: Bound 'eclipse/che' to 'eclipse/che:5.2.2' WARNING: bridge-nf-call-iptables is disabled WARNING: bridge-nf-call-ip6tables is disabled INFO: (che cli): 5.2.2 - using docker 1.13.0 / native INFO: INFO: --------------------------------------- INFO: -------- CONNECTIVITY TEST -------- INFO: --------------------------------------- INFO: (che network): eclipse/che-ip: 172.17.0.1 INFO: (che network): Browser => Workspace Agent (localhost): Connection failed INFO: (che network): Browser => Workspace Agent (172.17.0.1): Connection failed INFO: (che network): Server => Workspace Agent (External IP): Connection failed INFO: (che network): Server => Workspace Agent (Internal IP): Connection succeeded My first thought after seeing these lines was to look for configuration problems. I found the che.env file and read up on configuration at https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/setup/configuration/index.html. Because I do not have any machines with IP 172.17.0.1, I set so,e of the configurations (like the CHE_HOST) to the address of the machine I was running Che on. My configuration attempts failed. First, Che continued to generate the same failures as the ones in the connectivity test above. These were the exact same messages: attempts to connect to 172.17.0.1! The only difference in the messages this time was an additional warning saying that I had overridden 172.17.0.1 with my machine's IP address! Despite everything I tried, Che keeps insisting on attempting to connect to non- existent 172.17.0.1. I am pretty sure I am missing something here, but I have no idea what that is. I have read through che.env and the configuration page, but have had no real help in stopping those connection failures. So what am I missing. Someone please advise...
