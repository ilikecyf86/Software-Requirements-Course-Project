Provide documentation for adding a stack to the default Che assembly
kind/bug 
Currently the docs are here: https://github.com/codenvy/che-docs/blob/master/src/main/_docs/workspace-administration/ws-stacks.md The section "Adding Stacks to the Che Default Assembly" currently just says "//TODO". The previous documentation at [1] instructs adding the stack to [2], however doing this has no effect and in fact this file can be removed completely and the list of default stacks in Che remains unchanged.
