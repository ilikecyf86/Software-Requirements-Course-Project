Hello, Some flags cannot be set up in che.properties when running a che workspace (docker run [flags]...). It is the case with --cap-add (in my case I would like to add the NET_ADMIN capacity). We can set the --privileged flag, but it is too much. Do you plan to give the possibility to add cap-add in che.properties? I see that we can already set it directly in MachineProviderImpl thanks to withCapAdd(new String[] {"NET_ADMIN"}) but I don't want to change che-plugin-docker-machine. I don't think there is a way to change the docker run command used when launching a workspace otherwise? (asking in case I missed something)
