Remove unnecessary files from workspace snapshots

When Che saves snapshot it includes agents binaries into snapshot. This means that we can speed up creation of snapshots by excluding these files from snapshot somehow. Since snapshotting doesn't respect .gitignore or any other rules to reduce snapshot size in can take a lot of time to snapshot workspace with big amount of binaries. And some agents like ws-agent can be space-consuming. Also since snapshots are layered entity snapshoting of same WS will constantly slowing down. Reproduction Steps: Start WS. Save WS into snapshot. Get snapshot data from SQL DB. Execute docker run -it <registry:port/repo_of_snapshot> bash -c ls ~/che
 Expected behavior: Nothing is printed or error message that ~/che doesn't exist. Observed behavior: Something like terminal websocket-terminal-linux_amd64.tar.gz ws-agent is printed. Che version: 5.0.0-Snapshot OS and version: Ubuntu 16.04 Docker version: 1.12.5 Che install: Docker container Additional information: Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: [No] Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: [Yes]
