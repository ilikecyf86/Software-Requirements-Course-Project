Chefile error: location is undefined in workspace.runtime.image.location
kind/question severity/P2 kind/bug status/code-review status/code-review 
I used the CLI che dir init command to get a Chefile and then added this line workspace.runtime.image.location="node:6". But this gives me an error when I run che dir up: WARNING: No kernel memory limit support
ERROR: ECLIPSE CHE(dir): Error: Error while parsing the file '/d/Projects/Tests/che-dir/Chefile' at line 3 and column 33. The error is :Cannot set property 'location' of undefined
 Reproduction Steps: Get the CLI Make sure you set the vars like suggested CHE_DATA=<somedir> and CHE_VERSION=nightly Switch to the che dir getting started guide and make sure you set CHE_UTILITY_VERSION=nightly Go into an empty folder and run che dir init. Open the generated "Chefile" and add workspace.runtime.image.location="node:6". Run che dir up. Expected behavior: Start a che server with a workspace that has the node:6 image. Observed behavior: WARNING: No kernel memory limit support
