When we delete widgets (terminals or command output widgets) from ProcessPanel, this widgets are still exist in the memory, because in the code we didn't clean up them correctly. This is ProcessPanel performance issue, because references to deleted widgets still exists and we have a problems, for example, with resize process panel, because we resizes existing widgets with already deleted widgets, so ui begin resize with lags. Main goal this is issue: correctly clean up maps in the ProcessPanelPresenter and ProcessPanelViewImpl. OS and version: Fedora 24 (os version doesn't matter in this case). CHE version: 5.3.0-SNAPSHOT
