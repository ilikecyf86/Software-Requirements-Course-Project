From @balzer814 on July 25, 2017 15:3 When adding a file/folder with '%' in the name codenvy returns 400 Bad Request. It is possible to create a folder with such a name using the terminal, but this folder can later not be opened in the ide. When creating such a file over the terminal and than open it in the IDE the opened Editor only says 'An error occoured while loading the file.' Reproduction Steps: open new...-> folder dialog type in '%name' as directory name click ok codenvy shows an error message: Codenvy version: 5.15.0 Copied from original issue: codenvy/codenvy#2337
