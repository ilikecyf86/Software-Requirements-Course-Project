When I use the 'Navigate To File', then it finds files from hidden folders. This is a bug. Reproduction Steps: Open a project in the IDE (e.g. web-java-spring from template). Call 'Navigate To File' from menu or by keyboard 'Ctrl+Alt+N'. Enter symbol 'p'. Expected behavior: should not be found files from hidden folders. Observed behavior: in the pop up there are files from hidden folder. Che version: 5.2.0-SNAPSHOT OS and version: Ubuntu 14.04 Docker version: 1.12 Che cli.log output: cli.log.zip Additional information: Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: [Yes] See the attachments:
