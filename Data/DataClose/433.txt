Unable to see Swagger documentation for WS Agent REST APIs
kind/question 
When I enter the URL in my browser: http://192.168.99.100:8080/swagger/?URL=http://192.168.99.100:32811/api/docs/swagger.json where 32811 is the port of my WS Agent I only see Swagger documentation for WS Master REST APIs (e.g., agent, factory, preferences, profile...). I even see documentation for my own REST API that is in WS Master. Reproduction Steps: OS and version: Windows 7 using Oracle VirtualBox I followed the instructions here: https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/assemblies/sdk-rest-apis/ I would like to see Swagger REST API documentation for my APIs that run in the WS Agent. Also, I'd like to see them for the /Project REST API and other Che REST APIs that run in WS Agent. I am running a custom assembly with Che 5.17.
