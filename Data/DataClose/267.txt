Description GDB debugging does not work in Eclipse Che 5.20-SNAPSHOT even though privileged mode is enabled. GDB debugging without specifying the port for gdbserver does not work at all when correctly specifying the port, debugging crashes instantly using GDB from command line to connect to gdbserver works Reproduction Steps Following the guide in https://eclipse.org/che/docs/ide/debug/index.html#gdb with Che_DOCKER_PRIVILEGED=true Use C++ stack and cpp console application sample add int test1 = 200; to the main function to have a variable and set a breakpoint on it compile with the run command (or use gcc -g Hello.cc directly) Start the gdbserver with gdbserver :4000 a.out Try to connect to gdb through the che gui by going to run -> debug -> edit debug configuration, set the port to 4000 as specified above The debug window opens briefly and crashes instantly (breakpoints are visible, but no variables. "gdb 7.1.. flashes up briefly in the top right corner of the debug window) OS and version: Debian 9 (64bit), Chrome 62 Diagnostics: TODO: Pass absolute path to the file where breakpoint is set Move all server side tests into the docker container like Java Debugger does
