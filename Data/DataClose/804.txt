Support for Executing LSP WorkspaceEdit
team/osio sprint/current-sprint status/in-progress status/code-review status/in-progress 
In LSP, a WorkspaceEdit is a sequence of text changes affecting multiple files that may or may not be open in an editor. We need to be able to execute such workspace wide edits to implement things like rename (https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/protocol.md#textDocument_rename), but they could also be used to implement code action commands (see #3957).
