Allow combining multiple stacks to a new one
kind/enhancement 
Please add support for combining multiple stacks to a new one on the http://eclipse-che:8080/dashboard/#/create-project project dashboard. Since the custom stack documentation seems to be not available for now (at least the link in nightly points to a site telling me that) and I could easily put together what I need by just picking multiple items from the stack library, this seems like a natural thing to offer for people who have custom needs but which aren't deeply familiar with eclipse che just yet - at least from a usability perspective, I'm not sure how technically feasible it is. Reproduction Steps: Start fresh eclipse che install with empty data folder Go to project dashboard Try to somehow choose multiple stacks to be combined to a new one (what I observed: I see no obvious way on how to do it) Che version: Your CLI version is 'nightly'.
