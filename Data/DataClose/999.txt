How to tell Che to only build one type of browser JavaScript with new Che extension
kind/question 
Hello, With the old Che, it was possible to tell Che to only build one type of browser JavaScript: <!-- Tell Che to only build one type of browser JavaScript -->
<!-- Values can be 'safari' or 'firefox'.  Safari builds for chrome -->
<set-property name="user.agent" value="safari"/>
 But now the file /assembly/assembly-ide-war/src/main/resources/org/eclipse/che/ide/IDE.gwt.xml does not exist anymore with the new Che. Is it still possible with the new Che to edit this property somewhere to make the build process faster ?
