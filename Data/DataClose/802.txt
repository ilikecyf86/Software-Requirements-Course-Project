 but also for different WARNING and ERROR messages from .net runtime, like: ppp/PPPProgram.cs(9,17): warning CS0219: The variable 'testIntValue' is assigned but its value is never used [/home/zzz/projects/csharp/hwapp/hwapp.csproj]

Program.cs(2,13): error CS0234: The type or namespace name 'ppp' does not exist in the namespace 'hwapp' (are you missing an assembly reference?) [/home/zzz/projects/csharp/hwapp/hwapp.csproj]
