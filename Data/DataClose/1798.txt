How to enable existing syntax highlighting for scala
kind/question 
There is a tutorial in https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/code-editors#section-syntax-highlighting on how to add a syntax highlighting for a user language. They say: Add extension with mime type to File Extension Registry. There is already a scala and sbt definition in https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/ide/che-core-ide-api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/ide/api/editor/filetype/ExtensionFileTypeIdentifier.java this.mappings.put("scala", Collections.singletonList("text/x-scala"));
this.mappings.put("sbt", Collections.singletonList("text/x-scala"));// scala build definition
 However, when I create a file with .scala extention in some project, there is no syntax highlighting. Expected behavior: It is expected to see the highlighting. Observed behavior: No highlighting.
