REST call fails from GWT view, but works from menu action in Che

I have an action class that performs a REST call via my client class. I invoke the action from a menu, and it works perfectly fine. When I use the Action Manager to retrieve the same action and run it from a view, I get a ServerDisconnectionException. The stack trace with the exception is not very helpful. I am attaching the following Java classes to show what I am doing: NavigatorServiceClientImpl.java - performs the REST calls. GetPackagesAction.java - Successfully invokes the REST API client and gets a list of web tree nodes from the server ServiceDevPackageNavigatorViewImpl.java - extends org.eclipse.che.ide.api.parts.base.BaseView. Invokes the REST API client, but gets ServerDisconnectionException. ServiceDevGinModule.java - binds ServiceDevServiceTesterView to ServiceDevPackageNavigatorViewImpl Che version: 5.0.0-M6 OS and version: Linux usrscp28 4.4.0-53-generic #74-Ubuntu SMP Fri Dec 2 15:59:10 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux system VMware Virtual Platform bus 440BX Desktop Reference Platform memory 87KiB BIOS processor Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2660 0 @ 2.20GHz Docker version: 1.12.1 API version: 1.24 Che install: Codenvy This is the first version of Che I have worked with.
