How to deploy an application built on top of che without using source code repo?
kind/question 
Hello, Am playing around with Eclipse Che. I have the following usecase. 1.Deploy a WAR file in to che server's IDE container. The WAR file has UI + services that interact with Che Workspace server. 2. Am starting the che docker container in the following way docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /c/Users/myuser/che_data:/data -v /c/Users/myuser/che:/repo -e CHE_LOCAL_BINARY=/c/Users/myuser/che/assembly/assembly-main/target/eclipse-che-5.8.1/eclipse-che-5.8.1 eclipse/che:5.8.1 start \ In case if am not specifying the repo( the sources), there's a problem starting the docker container. Do we need the sources to build the container ? Are the che_local_binary is not sufficient for the docker container to start up? What would be an ideal way to deploy the che for production ? Also I want to know is there a way, I could get access to the tomcat container of the che server to deploy WAR files. Regards Santhosh
