The Recent Workspaces in the left navbar is having the following behaviors: It always displayed the latest 5 opened workspaces It keeps order accurate (with time of the latest open action) We need to simplify this a bit, so it avoid being updated too oftenly: we order the list only when we first load it we don't change the order so if a user is opening a workspace from the list, it will stay displayed at its current position when a workspace is opened and is not in the list, we add it by replacing the workspace which was opened since the oldest time.
