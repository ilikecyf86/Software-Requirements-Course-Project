kind/bug sprint/next-sprint status/open-for-dev team/enterprise status/in-progress status/open-for-dev sprint/current-sprint sprint/next-sprint status/pending-merge status/in-progress status/pending-merge sprint/current-sprint 
When I try to change commit message by the 'Amend previous commit' in the commit form, I have unexpected error. Reproduction Steps: Open in the IDE a project (e.g. web-java-spring from template). Make a change in a file and perform commit. Try to change the massage of commit by 'Amend previous commit'. Expected behavior: commit message should be changed. Observed behavior: nothing is changed and there is unexpected error. Che version: 5.1.0-SNAPSHOT OS and version: Ubuntu 14.04 Docker version: 1.12 Che cli.log output: cli.log.zip Additional information: Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: [Yes] See the attachment:
