che init does not create any files in host folder
kind/question 
I wanted to generate the che.evn file using the che init command, but the host folder mounted to /data always remains empty. Reproduction Steps: I tried the following che init command as specified here docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /C/ajay_temp/testProjects/docker/eclipse_che:/data eclipse/che init
 The results were the same with the che start command too i.e. the host folder corresponding to the /data folder was always empty. Che version: Your CLI version is '5.1.1'.
