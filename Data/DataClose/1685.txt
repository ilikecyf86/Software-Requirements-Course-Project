Workspace config json modification
kind/question team/platform 
Hi, for the past weeks i have been trying to make modifications on eclipse che requests to the REST API, with the purpose of adding a single parameter on the config field on the JSON for the workspace creation. I managed to find where to modify, wsmaster module, and started modifying and wrote tests for the files that were modified to see if the module was still working. The module passed all tests on the files that i modified, i checked using mvn clean test, and it seemed to work on theory but the validations didn't work when che was executed, rather were ignored. My doubts are: To make the modification on the body of the request, wsmaster is the correct module? If it isn't, what other modules i have to modify? My second question is, which i think it is too much for you guys to answer but i will ask it anyway, can you give me tips to make this modification? Since of now i thank you for your patience and help. Che version: 4.7.0 OS: Ubuntu 16.04
