No docs on how to get a preview URL for a webserver
kind/docs severity/P1 
I was able to find this page https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/ide/previews/index.html however, it is incomplete and not up to date. I failed to find docs on: Adding Servers in UD Exposing ports in a custom recipe @JamesDrummond maybe I am missing smth, but I failed to find any info on that. And that's very basic and important information for an average user.
