Add ability to test connection to a private registry
kind/enhancement 
I would like to be able to test the connection to a private docker registry from edit screen, to make sure I have connectivity and authentication set up correctly. Reproduction Steps: Go to Administration -> Docker Registries. Create a new registry, or edit an existing one. Expected behavior: In the modal dialog that asks for address, username, and password, I would like to see a button that says "Test connection" and which reports success or failure of making a simple authenticated call to the docker registry. Observed behavior: This button sadly only exists in my mind. Che version: 4.7.2 / 5.0.0 OS and version: Ubuntu 16.04 Docker version: Docker 1.12.5 Che install: Docker container Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: No Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes
