Rework select dropbox popup to be same width as
kind/bug sprint/next-sprint status/open-for-dev team/plugin severity/P2 sprint/current-sprint sprint/next-sprint status/open-for-dev sprint/current-sprint 
The proposal popup of the select dropbox is now having the width equal to it's content. Need to handle the width to be the same as the label box above.
