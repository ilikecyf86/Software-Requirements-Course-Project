CHE_SERVER_IMAGE_NAME in 4.7.0 changed for 5.2.2?
kind/question 
Hello, I need an information: until now I was using version 4.7.0, but just switched for the 5.2.2. I was previously using -e CHE_SERVER_IMAGE_NAME=name_custom_image in order to have a custom che-server image. However, this variable seems to have no effect with version 5.2.2. I tried to find documentation about it but only found this: https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/setup/docker/index.html that does not refer to it.
