Not able to add commands on workspace created with eclipse chedir
kind/question 
Hi, I have created a local workspace using chedir as below: :\kevin\data\utilityapp>docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v C:\kevin\data3:/data -v C:\kevin\data3:/chedir eclipse/che:latest dir up WARN: Bound 'eclipse/che' to 'eclipse/che:5.9.1' INFO: (che cli): 5.9.1 - using docker 17.03.1-ce / docker4windows INFO: (che dir): Generating default /C/kevin/data3/Chefile INFO: (che dir): Adding /C/kevin/data3/.che directory INFO: (che dir): Starting Eclipse Che silently INFO: (che dir): Eclipse Che will be available at http://localhost:8080 (it's running but configuration is still in progress) INFO: (che dir): Workspace created INFO: (che dir): Workspace booting...

INFO: (che dir): Executing post-loading commands INFO: (che dir): Workspace booted and ready for development INFO: (che dir): Connect to http://localhost:8080/dashboard/#/ide/che/local When I open the project in editor and try adding a command I get the error "Failed to execute command. Machine not found". I have attached screenshot of the same. OS and version:* Windows 2000 I have also attached screenshot of the output of docker commands for images and containers on my system. Can you please suggest what could be the issue Thanks, Kevin
