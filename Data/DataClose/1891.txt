Project explorer synchronize is not optimized
kind/enhancement kind/bug severity/P1 kind/enhancement 
When I add an empty file using terminal I see a loader 'Project structure update` or something similar and that makes me realize that probably project explorer synchronization is not optimally done which may lead to a huge performance issue. If I understand correctly there is no real need for project structure update when we just need to synchronize addition of a single empty file. I foresee that will make a lot of problems: for example when we update several files we run project structure update for each one which is ridiculous. Please correct me if I misunderstood the logic that stands behind project explorer synchronization procedure. Steps to reproduce: Import https://github.com/eclipse/che Add a file in the root of the project using terminal Enjoy Expected behavior: update only one file Actual behavior: update all project structure Branch: https://github.com/eclipse/che/tree/dynamic-fw
