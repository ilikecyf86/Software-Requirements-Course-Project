But it doesn't work on OCP In case of using a service account (with missing credentials) che-server doesn't have rights to create objects outside of its project. In case of using user's credentials, there is another error 2017-10-05 15:34:59,923[nio-8080-exec-5]  [ERROR] [o.e.c.a.w.s.WorkspaceRuntimes 270]   - Unexpected response (401 Unauthorized), to the authorization request.
