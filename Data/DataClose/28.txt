Info about active part is incorrect in some cases
kind/bug target/che6 status/code-review team/ide status/code-review 
Description We throw ActivePartChangedEvent on client side when some part becomes active. But we don't change info about active part when this one becomes hidden. So, for example, when we ask WorkspaceAgent active part when active part is hidden - it returns incorrect info. It leads for some bugs on client side for cases when logic depends on active part.
