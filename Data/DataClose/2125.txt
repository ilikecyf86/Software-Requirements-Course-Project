Wordpress issue www-data:www-data
kind/question 
To update plugins in a wordpress installation i updated the file folder ownership of the project in eclipse to www-data:www-data. However at the moment that broke the file explorer in eclipse. anybody suggestions how to fix this and keep wordpress updating plugings directly? Workspace: PHP-default-stack Project Source: Git - Wordpress Step 1 - in terminal sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nano sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin (and complete all steps) Step 2 - setup wordpress Step 3 - change the project directory owner to www-data:www-data to give the wordpress website permission to update plugins directly. Now my file explorer in the eclipse ide appears to by in 'read only' mode. I tried to add 'user' to the www-data group and this didn't solve the problem. Next i changed the owner to user:www-data wich solved the IDE problem but my wordpress install is not updating plugins.
