Code completion on large files moves cursor randomly to top of file
kind/bug severity/P2 team/ide 
I've noticed that the code editor on Che on large files (> 1000 LOC) has some strange behavior. I suspect that this is because of the current way that sends the entire contents of the file over to the server. As the LOC increases, this becomes a real bottleneck. Reproduction Steps: I can reproduce the issue on a local installation of Che, but you can see the issue easily on the Codenvy version as well. Start up a new Che workspace with Java support. For this example, use the che-on-che project. Wait for the maven configuration to take effect so that we can get code completion. Pick a file that is > 1000 LOC. I used XMLTreeTest.java Navigate to the end of the file (this is not strictly necessary but is how I tested). Start typing quickly and invoke code completion. Notice if you start typing too quickly, it bounces your cursor to the top of the file randomly. See attached gif. I've noticed the same issue with Che locally on my own, simple language server. This makes it hard to use Che for code editing of larger files. I think this is an underlying issue with the current Che protocol. Are there any plans to optimize this? OS and version: OS X and Chrome, but this shouldn't matter.
