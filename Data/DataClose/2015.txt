Issues with documentation popup for LSP code completion
kind/bug 
The documentation popup for LSP code completion has some shortcomings: No scrollbars The documentation is displayed in plain text. Although LSP does not enforce any particular format yet (see Microsoft/language-server-protocol#111), popular documentation formats like JavaDoc and PHPDoc contain HTML tags. It would be better to render them instead of displaying them raw, thus making the documentation more readable. Clicking on the popup hides it, thus making impossible to select and copy some text from the documentation. Flickering of the popup while typing Reproduction Steps: Build from the latest master. Start a workspace with the PHP stack and some project sample. Open the PHP editor. Invoke code completion and wait for the documentation popup to appear. Expected behavior: Scrollbars when necessary HTML tags are rendered Possible to select and copy some text from the documentation No flickering while typing Observed behavior: Che version: latest master OS and version: Fedora 24 Docker version: 1.10.3 Che install: server (zip) Additional information: Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: [No] Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: [Yes]
