As a developer I would like to be able to stop/cancel workspace startup once it is in progress if I realize I have mis-selected the workspace. Having to wait for the workspace to complete startup is not ideal. For newly created workspaces When the starting workspace is cancelled it should be stopped and return to the state it was in before starting. For existing workspaces When a newly created workspace is cancelled the workspace should be stopped and destroyed. API cancel workspace start #3742 Allow to cancel workspace start from UI #3743
