When a user tries to push to a remote repository with git or svn the message just tells the user it fails to unauthorized. We should provide a better message that tells the user that it failed due to credentials but also direct them to docs to get additional information. Message: You are not authorized to perform this operation.
This may be because you have not setup SSH keys, oAuth or a username/password.
Check the documentation for using Git / SVN for more information on setting these up.
 This will be the same message for codenvy. Referenced issue codenvy/codenvy#968
