kind/bug sprint/next-sprint team/ide status/in-progress sprint/current-sprint sprint/next-sprint 
When I recreate workspace from the same stack then the template project is created recursively. Reproduction Steps: On the dashboard go to 'Dashboard' -> 'Create Workspace' -> 'Create new workspace from stack' (e.g. Java ready stack) Delete the workspace and create it again In the IDE expand the project (e.g. console-java-simple) Expected behavior: the project should not be another project in himself Observed behavior: the project is created recursively Che version: 5.4.0 OS and version: Ubuntu 14.04 Docker version: 1.12 Che install: Docker container Additional information: Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: [Yes] See the attachment:
