Latest eclipse che image complains about /data not mounted although it is, and stops with exit code 2
kind/question status/info-needed kind/bug severity/P2 team/pm kind/question status/pending-merge status/info-needed 
Starting eclipse che, I am getting a message saying /data is not mounted: eclipse_1 | WARN: You are using CLI image version 'latest' which is set to '5.1.1'.
eclipse_1 |  WARNING: Usage of loopback devices is strongly discouraged for production use. Either use `--storage-opt dm.thinpooldev` or use `--storage-opt dm.no_warn_on_loop_devices=true` to suppress this warning.
eclipse_1 | WARN: Did not detect TTY - interactive mode disabled
eclipse_1 | INFO: Welcome to Eclipse Che!
eclipse_1 | INFO: 
eclipse_1 | INFO: We could not detect a location to save data.
eclipse_1 | INFO: Volume mount a local directory to ':/data'.
 Afterwards, it stops with exit code 2. However, the inspect has the mount listed:         "Mounts": [
            {
                "Source": "/home/jonas/Develop/eclipse-che/volumes/data",
                "Destination": "/data",
                "Mode": "rw",
                "RW": true,
                "Propagation": "rprivate"
            },
            {
                "Source": "/var/run/docker.sock",
                "Destination": "/var/run/docker.sock",
                "Mode": "rw",
                "RW": true,
                "Propagation": "rprivate"
            }
        ],
 Also, the respective docker-compose.yml I wrote contains it too: version: '2'

services:
  eclipse:
    image: eclipse/che
    volumes:
    - ./volumes/data/:/data
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    command: start
 Reproduction Steps: Start eclipse/che with docker-compose up -d Check log with docker-compose logs Observe process is gone with docker-compose ps Che version: version seems to be broken by this too, although clearly it shouldn't need the data directory to be existant: [root@falcon eclipse-che]# docker-compose run eclipse version
