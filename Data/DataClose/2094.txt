File Sync agent is disabled by default
kind/question 
Background che mount command would fail if File Sync agent would be disabled. It looks for me that by default all workspaces having Unison File Synchronizer option disabled. If users wish to use file sync they need to enable it in workspace options. This information is missing from in documentation: https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/desktop-ide-mounting Required actions Add info to https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/desktop-ide-mounting to enable agent before executing sync. Provide some useful information when executing che mount. We can do this by querying GET /workspace/{id}/check and see if org.eclipse.che.unison agent is enabled. Steps to reproduce Create default java workspace ( File Sync disabled) Try to sync it localy using guide: https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/desktop-ide-mounting che mount command returns no results - file sync failed.
