REST method for batch creating Projects suitable for both import and generate
kind/enhancement sprint/next-sprint team/ide sprint/current-sprint sprint/next-sprint status/code-review status/code-review 
Solve several problems: be able to declare template for project generating (for factory, stacks etc), not only importing (as we have currently) be able to simplify flow when it is needed to create several projects in one shot be able to declare subprojects but generate sources for only root project (one sources import/generation, several projects entries) This method may replace old create and import methods in future (could be deprecated) Proposed method to Project REST service POST /project/projects or /project/batch or /project/list object to send will look like: [
 {
  config: - mandatory project config (all the fields but path are optional)
  generator: - like current for create method (optional)
 }
]
 Flow: POST /project/batch method gets JSON with List of NewProjectConfig object. NewProjectConfig object contains only one mandatory Project Path field. In this case Project is created as Blank Before apply validate objects whether it contains Path field. If some does not throw 400 Before apply validate if the same path project exists. Throw 409 with message containing Project path (or delete if overwrite) If NewProjectConfig contains Source: - try to import - if error occured (the Source not reachable) - generate Project with Problem 10 ( "No source") - if import succeeded - update Project with PT, Attributes etc If there are NO Source - generate project. Use specific generator with Options if any If there are NO Primary PT configured Project is created as Blank (Do we need to change ProjectManager to choose behaviour?) If declared primary PT is not registered, project is created as Blank, with Problem 12 If declared mixin PT is not registered, project is created w/o it, with Problem 12
