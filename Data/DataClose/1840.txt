In UD when user edits some jsons like configuration of WS on WS creation there are 2 buttons: apply and save. Apply is location a bit far and user might not see it and press save. The problem is that on clicking "save" UD discards changes silently. Reproduction Steps: Open UD. Open WS creation view. In the WS configuration editing view go into "Workspace config" section. Edit something. Click save. Go into "Workspace config" section and check changes. Expected behavior: UD inform that changes should be applied before saving or UD applies changes automatically. Observed behavior: UD creates WS but discarded made by user changes. Che version: 5.0.0-Snapshot OS and version: Ubuntu 16.04 Docker version: 12 Che install: Docker container
