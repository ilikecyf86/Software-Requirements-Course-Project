We should make it possible to launch existing selenium tests on OCP assembly.I think it will be complete with 2 phases: Make possible running existsing tests, analyzing results. Exclude tests that fail for known reasons (like permission restrictions or absent functionality) Make test suite with actual tests and run it on CI
