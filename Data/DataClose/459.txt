Reproduction Steps: Open a workspace with a project. Make changes in a few files from the same directory. Open commit window, uncheck some files from the directory. The directory is still checked like all files inside are checked. But actually some files aren't included into commit. It is confusing and error prone. My suggestion is to add third state to checkbox for folders, like or and it will appears only if some (not all) internal nodes are checked. In case if a user clicks on third-state checkbox it should jump to unchecked state and uncheck all subnodes recursively.
