Move maven impl module tests execution to integration phase

@akorneta discovered that tests of maven-server-impl module take too much time. With disabled UD compilation and enabled GWT module overall build takes 51 minutes on a test machine. And 30 minutes from these 51 is execution of maven-server-impl module. The simplest solution would be to move these tests in the integration phase of the build. Since they are using real local maven it is definitely job of integration phase. By the way on my Fedora 25, maven 3.5 these tests don't pass.
