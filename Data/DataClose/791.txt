We have a ProjectExplorer native object as part of IDE one - https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/ide/che-core-ide-app/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/ide/part/explorer/project/ProjectExplorerPresenter.java#L235. There is need in refresh method (updates the list of projects) to be called from the parent application, when IDE is loaded in iframe.
