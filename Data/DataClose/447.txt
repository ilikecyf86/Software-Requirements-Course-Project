Now we use one OpenShift project for OpenShift objects of one workspace. But it doesn't suit for some cases. It is needed to add an ability to create all user's workspaces in one OpenShift project. So there should be implemented different project choosing strategies: One OpenShift project for one workspace. One OpenShift project for all Che workspaces. There should be an ability to configure this strategy by external configuration. To implement this it is needed to label all workspace objects which are related to one workspace with its id. To ensure that services use only pods from the same workspace should be solved by adding the same entry to Service#spec#selector field.
