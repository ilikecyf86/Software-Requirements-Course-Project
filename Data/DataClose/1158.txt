Allow macros to be used in the terminal
kind/enhancement 
Goals Allow user to use Che's macros in the terminal Details We have a long list of macros which can be used inside of commands: https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/ide/commands/index.html#macros Today those macros cannot be used in the terminal. The idea would be the following: If the user is inputting just a macro, we return and print the corresponding evaluation of that macros. If user is using a macros in command given in the terminal, we would evaluate it for execution in the given command. Linked issues codenvy/codenvy#2077
