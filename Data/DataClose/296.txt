Description I try to run a custom assembly created from the plugin-serverservice-archetype and it fails when I try to open a workspace: I see the flashing workspace icon which appears before the IDE layout is loaded and that's it. Reproduction Steps I have created an archetype like this: mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:2.4:generate -DarchetypeRepository=http://maven.codenvycorp.com/content/groups/public -DarchetypeGroupId=org.eclipse.che.archetype -DarchetypeArtifactId=plugin-serverservice-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=5.19.0 -DgroupId=com.sample -DartifactId=assembly -Dversion=5.19.0 -DinteractiveMode=false and I can build an assembly for that with mvn install in the root. Now I run this with: docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v <path_to_the_archetype_assembly>:/assembly -v :/data eclipse/che-cli:5.19.0 start When opening a workspace it gets stuck with the flashing workspace icon but never proceeds to the workbench. I was able see a 404 for this URL: http://:8080/che/wksp-pzqs?uid=220766 in my browser at that point. The same works with 5.17.0. OS and version: Linux / Ubuntu in Virtualbox. All operations done in the VM. Diagnostics: The root cause seems to be that _app/IDE.html (new between 5.17. and 5.19, replaces IDE.jsp) is not included in the custom assembly. I added: _app/IDE.html in the overlay configuration of the maven-war-plugin in the assembly-ide-war/pom.xml and then it worked.
