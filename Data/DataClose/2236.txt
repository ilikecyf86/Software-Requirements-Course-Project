Reproduction Steps: After setup of sh as default shell in the Codenvy - some commands that was saved early will be wrong. For example some workspace used command like: echo -e 'some text for check' > ~/check.txt. Expected behavior: After execution the command - should be created the check.txt file with next content: some text for check Observed behavior: The content in the file will be like: -e some text for check (-e flag will be added into file) This problem may do many unexpected results for commands, that were saved in the workspaces created earlier. The same problem can be in the factories, which use bash commands. Many users may be puzzled.
