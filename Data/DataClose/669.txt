From @burrsutter on June 7, 2017 2:6 When I click on the Terminal tab header, I also have to click into the window to give it focus and a cursor. This is particularly annoying when switching command tabs. How about the Terminal tab gain focus/cursor by default when clicked on and brought to the foreground.
