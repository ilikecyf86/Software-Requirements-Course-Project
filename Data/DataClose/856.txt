Communicate directly with language server api
kind/question 
I have a question. I want to use the language server from extern. Before I updated my Che version I did this with http://localhost:{agent_port}/api/languageserver/{command}/ Now this path is not valid. Is there any possibility to this in another way? Hope someone can help me. Thanks
