Editor is almost unusable - missing edits, automatically moving cursor to top
kind/bug severity/blocker team/ide 
The editor is behaving in a way which is making it challenging to use. I'm experiencing issues while reproducing the workshop doc instructions: 1- After few edits, the editor's cursor is moving to the top of the file 2- Some edits are lost (you can see at the end of the animated gif, that I input a d and it was removed nearly instantly) 3- Nearly each input fires the display of the modal loader at the middle of the screen
