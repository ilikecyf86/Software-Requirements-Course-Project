Reproduction Steps: Create and open java workspace. Create console-java-simple project. Start application in debug mode and set breakpoint into the main class. Create debug config and start debug. Restart workspace without stopping debug session in IDE. Start application in debug mode again and start debug. Expected behavior IDE clear old debug session and start new one. Actual wrong behavior Call of "Run > Debug > Debug 'Remote Java" top menu command doesn't affect. Debug is impossible, There is old session metadata in the Local Storage of browser. After the cleaning old session metadata from Local Storage of browser and refreshing browser, debug becomes an accessible. Screencast OS and version: Ubuntu 14.04 Chrome 57.0 Che 5.6.0-SNAPSHOT
