Make CLI show che-server start logs in dev mode
kind/task kind/enhancement kind/task 
Sometimes in development che-server doesn't start. It can happen if developer did mistake in configuration, etc. In that case CLI waits che-server too long. It would improve Che developers experience if these logs were shown by default, so developer identify problem immediately after looking at errors in logs.
