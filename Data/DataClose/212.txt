Add hotkeys for fast switching between tabs

Description Add hotkeys for fast switching between tabs (project tree, editor, terminal, etc.). Now it is needed to use a mouse for switching between tabs. I'd be happy to have an ability to manage tabs by hotkeys. It is proposed(it should be discussed and may be changed) to consider the following approach to implementing such hotkeys: One hotkey can do the following actions: make visible/active/invisible some tab. Action to perform depends on the current state of IDE: The corresponding tab is invisible -> make it visible and active The corresponding tab is active -> make it invisible The corresponding tab is inactive -> make it active Then we'll be able to set hotkeys with such behavior for different tabs, like: shift+alt+1 -> project tree shift+alt+t -> last active terminal Editor tab is a little bit different from other because it is central and can't be hidden (without maximizing another one). So shift+alt+e can change state in the following way: The editor is inactive -> make it active The editor is active -> maximize it The editor is maximized -> set normal mode
