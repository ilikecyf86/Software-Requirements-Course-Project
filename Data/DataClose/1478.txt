Failed to inject Orion editor when starting workspace
kind/bug sprint/next-sprint team/ide sprint/next-sprint severity/P2 
When creating a workspace, a notification "Failed to inject Orion editor" appears, and files cannot be opened in the editor. I suspect it's related to commit 1106913. I think @tsmaeder is facing the same issue. OS and version: Fedora 25, Docker 1.13.1, current master branch of repo.
