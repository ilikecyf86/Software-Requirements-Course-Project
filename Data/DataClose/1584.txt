Exposing Che running in Docker for Windows / Moby VM to External Clients
kind/question 
I set up my own Che Server, but I'm getting the "Unable to initialize IDE" error when trying to access it on a different PC that's not in the network. Reproduction Steps: Start up Che Try accessing on different PC (that's not in the network) Got the error OS and version: Windows 10 Eclipse Che 5.2.2 Diagnostics: docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v F:/EclipseChe/:/data -e CHE_HOST=192.168.178.26 -e CHE_DOCKER_IP_EXTERNAL=192.168.178.26 eclipse/che start Got the following: WARN: Bound 'eclipse/che' to 'eclipse/che:5.2.2' INFO: (che cli): 5.2.2 - using docker 1.13.0 / docker4windows WARN: CHE_HOST (192.168.178.26) overridden by che.env (83.85.179.146) INFO: (che start): Booted and reachable INFO: (che start): Ver: 5.2.2 INFO: (che start): Use: http://(Here is my external IP):8080 INFO: (che start): API: http://(Here is my external IP):8080/swagger PS: Why isn't there an easy documentation on setting up your own server that people are able to access w/ possible a login?
