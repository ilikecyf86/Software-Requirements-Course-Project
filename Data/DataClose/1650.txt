Che workspace is not stopped if env.var to stop inactive workspace is set
kind/question 
Using CHE_MACHINE_WS_AGENT_INACTIVE_STOP_TIMEOUT_MS property to set timeout when should be a workspace suspended does not work. After using this file in che.env and running instance with this env. var, workspace is running all the time. Reproduction Steps: EXEC: Init che files in a local data directory (e.g. through Che CLI). EXEC: Modify che.env to set property CHE_MACHINE_WS_AGENT_INACTIVE_STOP_TIMEOUT_MS to a timeout 300 seconds. EXEC: Start che with this configuration EXEC: Create a new workspace and let it be inactive. RESULT: After a specified amount of seconds by the property, the workspace is still running. I had set workspace to 600 seconds but it was running even after 20 minutes. Che version: nightly che OS and version: I think it affects all OSes Docker version: Does not matter, but 1.12.
