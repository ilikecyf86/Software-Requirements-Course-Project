when che create a workspace, it fails to update pod metadata

Hi, I have tested it on openshift 3.5. On openshift, I run che-host and I try to create workspace from dashboard. However, it failed to start up workspace due to following error message: INFO: {"kind":"Status","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{},"status":"Failure","message":"Pod \"che-ws-w8nj6d3fi1gs1mdu-505330371-tgnk7\" is invalid: spec: Forbidden: pod updates may not change fields other than `containers[*].image` or `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds`","reason":"Invalid","details":{"name":"che-ws-w8nj6d3fi1gs1mdu-505330371-tgnk7","kind":"Pod","causes":[{"reason":"FieldValueForbidden","message":"Forbidden: pod updates may not change fields other than `containers[*].image` or `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds`","field":"spec"}]},"code":422}
 Reproduction Steps: I followed this doc to set up eclipse che on openshift and try to create workspace. OS and version: RHEL7.3 Che 5.16.0 oc v3.5.5.26 kubernetes v1.5.2+43a9be4 features: Basic-Auth GSSAPI Kerberos SPNEGO Server https://master10.example.com:8443 openshift v3.5.5.26 kubernetes v1.5.2+43a9be4 Diagnostics: I debuged this issue and I realised this issue is from this code From APIwise, it uses following: curl -H "Accept: application/json, */*" -H "Authorization: Bearer *****" -H "User-Agent: oc/v1.5.2+43a9be4 (linux/amd64) kubernetes/43a9be4"   -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PATCH -d '[{"op":"add","path":"/metadata/labels/cheContainerIdentifier","value":"33a873da77f7"}]' https://master10.example.com:8443/api/v1/namespaces/eclipse-che/pods/che-ws-w8nj6d3fi1gs1mdu-505330371-tgnk7
 With same api with Content-Type is "application/json-patch+json", it is possible to change che-host pod but workspace pod still show same error messages. So I guess pod is something different from between deploymentConfig and replicaset. I attached 5 files : Workspace_Trace_Error.log / Success_API_with_che-host.log / Fail_API_with_workspace.log / openshift_webconsole.png / che_dashboard.png logs.zip
