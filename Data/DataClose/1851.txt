Make docker build use the same network as containers of WS

Docker build should use the same network as Docker containers of WS to prevent access to host when it is not desired. This feature is added in Docker 1.13 which is not released publicly yet, so we should do that after release. I believe it is compatible with previous versions and will be just ignored in that case. Reproduction Steps: Expose Docker daemon over tcp In dockerfile add access to docker API over curl Expected behavior: Curl fails. Observed behavior: Curl succeeds. Che version: 5.0.0-Snapshot OS and version: Ubuntu 16.04 Docker version: 12.04 Che install: Docker container, Codenvy Additional information: Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: [No] Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: [Yes]
