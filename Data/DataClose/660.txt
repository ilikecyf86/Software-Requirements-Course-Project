Actualize Eclipse Che Java coding standards
kind/task team/platform 
The goal of this issues is to revise our existed guidelines https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Coding-Guidelines and adapt it to realities and the challenges that we have today. As for me I can see such problems Unfortunately, Java has no single format standard like GO lang has and there is no single tool that all have to follow. Existed document is quite a long read and a bit hard to follow. More general: people want that this thing has to work some how, but not to pay a lot of attention to it. We want some kind of automation that can check if coding standards has followed. We don't to spend a lot of time to support different tools our format. Like config for Eclipse or config for IntelliJ, etc. I'm proposing following direction. We can use Google Java Style Guide https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html We can reformat existed code according to new rules. We can use https://github.com/google/google-java-format https://github.com/coveo/fmt-maven-plugin tool to automate format checking as we have with a license checking. We can reuse existing configuration of Google formatter for Eclipse IDE, Eclipse Che and IntelliJ
