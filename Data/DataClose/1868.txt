Dashboard "Create Workspace" button creates new project, not workspace
kind/question 
When the dashboard first comes up, if you have existing workspaces, they are listed. There's also a button above the list titled "Create Workspace". If you click it, you're taken to the "Create Project" page, which attempts to create a project within (the first??) workspace. I'm not sure if this is by design, but if so, it's not very clear. The 1-word code change for this would be in the dashboard source, last-workspaces.html line 7. It is clearly calling "create-project" instead of "create-workspace." I could probably submit a pull-request, but I've only done one of those in my life and it didn't work well.
