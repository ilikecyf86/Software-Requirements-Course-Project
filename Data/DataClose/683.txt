In dockerfiles/che/ there are 2 Dockerfiles to build the che-server image: Dockerfile: alpine based Dockerfile.centos: CentOS based Che CI is currently building the alpine based Dockerfile only. The CentOS based Dockerfile is used for k8s and OpenShift deployments and should be built too. The resulting CentOS based images should be tagged eclipse/che-server:nighlty-centos, eclipse/che-server:latest-centos, eclipse/che-server:5.15-centos and pushed to the docker hub. This new che-server image should not replace the Alpine based that is and will remain the default image to use when running Che on Docker.
