Swagger: do not display deprecated factory POST method
kind/task severity/P2 team/platform status/open-for-dev sprint/next-sprint status/in-progress status/open-for-dev status/in-progress sprint/next-sprint 
Currently, in FactoryService there are 2 POST methods annotated with Swagger. As a result, only one is displayed in Swagger - the one that has been deprecated (it consumes multipart form-data). The one that consumes application/json isn't displayed. Perhaps, it's a good idea to remove Swagger annotations from a deprecated method.
