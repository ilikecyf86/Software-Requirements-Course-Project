UX Improvements Goal improvement Clicking everyone on the dropdown must expand the list of choices. At this moment, user has to click only on the v arrow which is not convenient. We need to get ride of the ability to edit in the dropdown to create a new goal. We will list all the existing commands and have the last choice "New Command Goal...". If the user clicks on it, we will display a popup with title "New Command Goal" with a textfield and buttons [Create] [Cancel]. (when the popup is opened, the textfield is having the focus, so user can directly input) Shortcut for default "Run" and "Debug" commands Would suggest cmd+R for "Run" and cmd+D for "Debug" Properly close the command toolbar When the user stops a process from drop down the tab in process panel does not close. Previews dropdown menu not working Some areas in the dropdown are not allowing to select the preview. Add tooltip for process ID in command toolbar Refreshing the browser or reopening the workspace should reopen previous command's editors Properly clean the list of previews when a command is stopped QA reported situations where the list of previews is not cleaned after the commands have been stopped.
