Starting workspace hangs with symbolic file links in project
kind/question 
When I start a workspace with a large amount of files (>3GB) Eclipse Che makes it to the point where it echo's "[INFO ] [o.a.c.startup.HostConfig 911] - Deploying web application archive /home/user/che/ws-agent/webapps/ROOT.war" for the dev-machine, but then hangs and eventually the timeout error occurs. Reproduction Steps: Create a new workspace Load in a ton of files (>3GB) from svn, git, etc. Shutdown the workspace Restart the workspace Che version: 5.0.0-latest OS and version: Windows 10 Docker version: Client 1.12.5, Server 1.13.0
