This is the current Ui of the process panel needs to be improved: Process tree Remove the "dev" tag Rework the position of the "terminals" and "processes" nodes under a machine, so they look better aligned (whole node elements should be more to the left, as in the project explorer, and t). Terminal Margings At this moment we have some inconsistency with the margings. I think those inconsistency are coming from the scrollbars. We need to make sure that: between process and terminal, we have the same marging. we have the same marging (=1px) left-right-top-bottom The left alignement of 'command' + 'preview' is consistent with the outputs If needed, we will display the scrollbars with transparency over the content.
