Remove core/process -> core/rpc dependency

exec-agent/process package becomes core/process which allows to reuse it by different components. core/process package should not use a certain type of transport to bring its events to its clients, BUT it uses jsonrpc events right now as exec-agent didn't need anything else. Agent installer needs core/process functionality to execute agent installation scripts and stream its own events to the client, in this case core/process lib will do unnecessary work by wrapping process entities with jsonrpc models and agent installer will unwrap them back. The goal of the issue is to decouple core/process and core/rpc. Depends on #5131
