How to link an extension to IDE ?
kind/question 
Hi all, I'm trying to link my extension to the IDE. I read the documentation in this url . But couldn't find the .gwt.xml file in the description /che/assembly/assembly-ide-war/src/main/resources/org/eclipse/che/ide/IDE.gwt.xml I think the documentation has not been updated with the Gwt xml generator #4298 pull request
