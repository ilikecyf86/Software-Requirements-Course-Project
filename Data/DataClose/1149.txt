Cache causes that WS doesn't start
kind/question 
I have an issue on my workspace, sometimes I have to disable the cache to be able to start up my workspace. If I don't do it, the browser debug shows that some network request doesn't reach the IDE and the workspace stays down. The requests are "Machine" and "Process". I have to press F12 (browser Debug), and check "disable cache" and the workspace starts like nothing happened... Reproduction Steps: I am not sure how to reproduce it. What I have done was to install the latest version and nigthly version and try them on the same browser. I have restarted several times the docker and workspace, it didn't resolve the issue. I have disabled the cache, it worked.
