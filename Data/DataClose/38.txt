docker run -it --rm -e CHE_MULTIUSER=true -v ~/chedata_plain600m2:/data -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock eclipse/che:6.0.0-M2 start
 create an organization org and a sub-organization org/suborg create a workspace in the sub-organization go to "Workspaces" > "Add Workspace" select the suborg as organization (if the organization dropdown doesn't show, refresh the browser). Create the workspace The workspace loads properly Select "Workspaces" The list of workspaces shows the workspace just started Try to open the workspace that was just created. Bug: workspace doesn't open "The project's workspace is currently not open" message on the screen. There is another "Open" button, but when using it I get the message "Workspace doesn't exist.
