Jump to location in file
kind/enhancement 
For training use cases organizations want to be able to insert markdown or HTML documentation into the workspace (displayed in the editor or in a dedicated panel in the IDE). The user can read through the documentation and then click a link that opens a source code file to a specific location relevant to the task being documented. Ideally the link would be able to start a workspace or execute a Factory, however this isn't required for this phase. Requirements The link needs to operate only within the context of an already running workspace. The link will specify: The file to be opened. The line of the file on which to place the cursor (if unspecified it will be the first line) The character within that line on which to place the cursor (if unspecified it will be the 1st character) If the file isn't already open: open the file in the editor, placing the cursor in the specified location. If the file is already open: bring the file to the foreground of the editor and place the cursor in the specified location.
