Under this issue we need to revise what we have now for LS and all early created issues. We need to investigate the ability to support multiple Languages Servers per file (#4609) and start LS as micro-service in a separate container. As a result we expect a document which will contain the description of problems and the proposal of a resolution, close all not actual issues.
