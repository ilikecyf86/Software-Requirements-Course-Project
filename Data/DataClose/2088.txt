kind/question kind/bug kind/question 
I have installed Che several different ways and can connect to Che, start workspaces and access them from my Mac. I can access Che and start workspaces from my PC. I am unable to access workspaces from my PC. 1: git clone https://github.com/eclipse/che ; cd che ; ./che.sh start 2: docker run --rm -t -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -e CHE_IP=192.168.128.19 -e CHE_HOST_IP=192.168.128.19 -e CHE_DOCKER_MACHINE_HOST_EXTERNAL=192.168.129.19 eclipse/che:5.0.0-latest start Reproduction Steps: Install Che via either method above. I did not export any environment variables or set any che.properties. Create loopback alias to 192.168.65.2 Access Che from same machine. Everything is fine. Access Che from different machine. Can't access workspaces. Expected behavior: I expected to be able to access workspaces from a remote machine. Observed behavior: I can access Che and start workspaces from a remote machine. I am unable to access workspaces from a remote machine. Che version: 5.0.0-latest OS and version: MacOS Sierra Version 10.12.1 Docker version: 1.12.3(13776) Che install: Docker Container Additional information: This has never worked. When I debug on my PC inside Chrome, I see Chrome trying to access localhost instead of 192.168.128.19 when trying to connect to the workspace agents. This is 100% reproducible.
