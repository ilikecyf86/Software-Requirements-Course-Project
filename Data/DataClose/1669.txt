Creating a custom stack from a simple recipe is almost not possible. The use case is simple: I want to create a custom stack with a simple recipe "FROM stevanlm/my_custom_stack" I ran into different sort of issues which are making the flow very complex: 1- The custom stack was already "preconfigured" with a recipe, I didn't know how to change it 2- I added a second machine, but was still not able to delete the previous "dev-machine" 3- I renamed my new machine by "dev-machine" and I had some mixed values See the following gif recorded on codenvy.io, but same behaviour on Che. See the following issue from Codenvy: codenvy/codenvy#1578 The problem is about the following use case: As a user, I want to create a new stack and change the recipe used for a machine. The flow is the following today: I go to “Stack”, click on “Add Stack" —> A new stack is created, and with this stack, there is a default dev-machine preconfigured, using the image “codenvy/ubuntu_jdk8" Here, user is quite lost. He can’t change that recipe, unless he changes it in the raw configuration of the stack. —> We should have the ability to edit the recipe used for one of the machine (just an edit popup, as we do for the name of the stack) The second problem is a bug. When you add a second machine with name “toto” and then rename it with the name “dev-machine”, it craps the whole stack recipe. Che version: 5.0.0 - 5.1.0
