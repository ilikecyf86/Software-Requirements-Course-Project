Remove separation of selenium tests on stable/unstable/failed

Separation of selenium tests on stable/unstable/failed helped us to run acceptance tests on regular base when there was a big failure rate=15-20% with more than 90 failed tests. Now we decreased failure rate to 5-7% with 20-35 failed tests and it simplify test report analysis. It allows us to run all tests without separation on stable/unstable ones. It will be even simpler after we begin marking of tests which failed because of problem with product, by special fail("issue NNN") command with link to the issue which fixes the bug in product (#7510).
