kind/bug severity/P1 sprint/next-sprint status/open-for-dev team/platform sprint/next-sprint 
Reproduction Steps: Create/edit a factory on /dashboard/#/factory Under "Configuration" section, give your project some attribute in the JSON like: {
  "v": "4.0",
  "workspace": {
    "projects": [
      {
        "links": [],
        "name": "foo",
        "attributes": {
          "commands": [
            "{\"commandLine\":\"docker-compose up\", \"name\":\"Start server\", \"attributes\":{\"previewUrl\":\"\", \"goal\":\"Run\"}, \"type\":\"custom\"}"
          ]
        },
        "type": "blank",
        "source": {
          "location": "example.com",
          "type": "git",
          "parameters": {}
        },
        "path": "/foo",
        "problems": [],
        "mixins": []
      }
    ],
...
 Click "Update" (you may reload and note that the attributes field has the commands. Use the UI to change any value, for example use the UI to add or remove a common command in "Configure Commands" It should have kept the attributes but it replaced them with empty ones: "attributes": {}.
