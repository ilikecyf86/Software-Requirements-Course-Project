Loading Workspace Snapshots back into Eclipse CHE
kind/question 
Hi, I am working on Windows 2010. I have installed Docker for Windows and also Eclipse CHE server via docker commands. When I create a Workspace using any of the provided stacks and make change to it , a snapshot gets created for it which I can see if I execute the command docker images Now , my Docker crashed due to memory issues and I had to restart it and also load eclipse che container again. However I was not able to see the workspaces loaded into Eclipse CHE editor. My only option was to delete the snapshot and the workspace image. Can the workspace snapshot be made available in eclipse CHE editor post restart of eclipse CHE? Thanks, Kevin Reproduction Steps: OS and version: Diagnostics:
