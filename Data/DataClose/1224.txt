Che cli fails on 3G connection.
kind/question 
I was trying to run che locally when on a 3G connection. This fails with an error message (see below). My expectation would be that this works even when offline or on a bad connection: Error: docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /home/thomas/.che:/data -v /home/thomas/git/che:/repo eclipse/che:nightly start WARNING: Usage of loopback devices is strongly discouraged for production use. Either use --storage-opt dm.thinpooldev or use --storage-opt dm.no_warn_on_loop_devices=true to suppress this warning.
