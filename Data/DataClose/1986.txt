Starting the che server as an user (implementing the CHE_USER property)
kind/bug 
When CHE_USER environment variable is set Che server should be run as the specified user (otherwise, by default, it's run as root). That's currently broken. See https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CHE-6 Che version: any OS and version: any Docker version: any Che install: docker Additional information: Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: No Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes
