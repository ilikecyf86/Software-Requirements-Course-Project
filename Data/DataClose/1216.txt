[Feature Request] Ability to Filter Git Branches in the branches pop up
kind/enhancement sprint/current-sprint status/open-for-dev team/enterprise status/code-review status/open-for-dev status/code-review sprint/current-sprint 
I have a project with several git remotes. When selecting a branch, there is a very large list of branches from each remote that I have set up with the project. It is very cumbersome to have to scroll to the exact branch that I need ( I'd rather use the git command line to do it ). This can be fixed if there was a filter input box on the top of the branches sections so that I can fuzzy find the branch that I am looking for. Reproduction Steps: Turn on workspace with git project click on menu option git > branches window should popup with a list of all available git branches. I have to scroll down to the remote/branch that I want. Expected Results: Turn on workspace with git project click on menu option git > branches window should popup with a list of all available git branches with a filter input box on the top of the list. When I start typing the branch that I want, it will filter down to match what I am typing. OS and version: OS: Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 Version: 5.6.0-SNAPSHOT Diagnostics: N/A
