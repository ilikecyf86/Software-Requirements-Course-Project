In CHE FARM mode, Run the second che-server:5.2.2 instance destroyed the first instance or its dev-machine
kind/question 
I want to support multi-user in my system, so I select CHE FARM mode to run multiple che-server instance in my virtual machine. I was failed to implement it by the following to ways. My environment: Centos 7 run in Virtualbox, docker 1.12.5, eclipse che 5.2.2, host external ip: 10.0.0.4 User 1 data space: /work/space/9090 User 2 data space: /work/space/9100 First way, I directly use the image eclipse/che:5.2.2: docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /work/space/9090:/data -v /work/che522/che/assembly/assembly-main/target:/assembly -e CHE_HOST=10.0.0.4 -e CHE_PORT=9090 -e CHE_CONTAINER=durts eclipse/che:5.2.2 start So, there is a new che-server container named 'durts' work correctly, I can browse it vas 10.0.0.4:9090. After that, I start the second instance, i want it work with different port 9100: docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /work/space/9100:/data -v /work/che522/che/assembly/assembly-main/target:/assembly -e CHE_HOST=10.0.0.4 -e CHE_PORT=9100 -e CHE_CONTAINER=super eclipse/che:5.2.2 start Nothing wrong was found in the command INFO. The new che-server instance named 'super' running now, but the first running instance 'durts' is SHUTDOWN!! Second way, I start the image eclipse/che-server:5.2.2 by docker-compose: In /work/space/9090/instance, run : docker-compose --file="docker-compose.yml" -p="durts" up -d --no-recreate In /work/space/9100/instance, run : docker-compose --file="docker-compose.yml" -p="super" up -d --no-recreate The two instance can running correctly, but if I open a workspace machine in che-server 1, then start che-server 2, the running dev-machine is DESTROYED !! The contents of docker-compose.yml(same as docker-compose-container.yml) , instance/config/che.env, cli.log are in my reference files: 1-docker-compose.yml.txt 1-che.env.txt 1-cli.log.txt 2-docker-compose.yml.txt 2-che.env.txt 2-cli.log.txt Finally, Here are my questions: 1. How can I run multiple che-server instances in my virtual machine ? 2. How can I analysis the problems ? like debug info or detail logs, cli.log is too simple. Thanks a lot. Durts John 2017-02-16
