Ports should not be exposed automatically, but rather be explicitly defined in workspace config

Related to SPI. Machine info from workspace config must contain information about the exposed port in servers property:     "workspaceConfig": {
      "environments": {
        "default": {
          "machines": {
            "app/main": {
              "installers": [
                "org.eclipse.che.exec", "org.eclipse.che.terminal", "org.eclipse.che.ws-agent"
              ],
              "servers": {
                "web": {
                  "protocol": "http",
                  "port": "8080/tcp"
                }
              }
            }

 This would make it easier and more straight forward creating workspaces on different infrastructures ( e.g. no need for inspecting image while creating workspace against dockerimage recipe)
