Eclipse Che extension doesn't get loaded using Docker for Mac
kind/question 
We did set CHE_ASSEMBLY env var correctly pointing to our extension che assembly, but no matter how we tried, it just did not show up in the eclipse che IDE. It did work if we switched to mac virtualbox docker. Reproduction Steps: build a helloworld eclipse che extension following these steps: https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/helloworld-extension. Or you can clone my examples: https://github.com/guiguan/che, and https://github.com/guiguan/che-helloworld-sample. Remember to mvn clean install che-helloworld-sample first then che export CHE_ASSEMBLY={path_to_che_assembly_assembly-main/target/eclipse-che-{che_version}/eclipse-che-{che_version}} che start visit localhost:8080, and create a workspace Expected behavior: "Hello World" notification should be displayed in the list of events Observed behavior: No "Hello World" printed Che version: tried nightly, latest, 5.0.0-M7, and none of them worked on Docker for Mac OS and version: macOS 10.12.1 Docker version: 1.12.3 Che install: Docker container Additional information: Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: No Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes
