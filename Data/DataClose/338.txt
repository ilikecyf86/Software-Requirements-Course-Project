LSP editors don't show diagnostics.
kind/bug status/in-progress status/in-progress 
To reproduce: In a workspace, open a file that is handled by a language server (php, json, etc.) Put an error in the file Observe: you get an error indication in the file Fix the error From the workspace menu, select "stop" When the workspace is stopped, start it again by pressing the "start" button (don't refresh the browser) Open the same file Add the same error as before Observe: you don't get an error indication in the editor. The class PublishDiagnosticsReceiver should establish a listener for LSP textDocument/publishDiagnostics events. However, the #subscribe method is only called once when the GWT application is initialized (via dependency injection). When we use the workspace->stop menu in Che and then start the workspace again, the GWT app is not restarted and thus no listener is initialized.
