Where to specify credentials for subversion

I'd like to import a project from subversion. Our subversion repositories are accessed with user and password. Can these be specified somewhere in Che? Reproduction Steps: Workspace -> import project Select subversion in the import project dialog. Enter the svn url. Click on import Expected Behavior Project is imported into the workspace Observed behavior: java.lang.IllegalStateException: org.eclipse.che.ide.websocket.rest.exceptions.ServerException: svn: E170001: Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'http:///svn/sagtest/playground/InsurancePremiumsPackage/trunk' svn: E170001: OPTIONS of 'http:///svn/sagtest/playground/InsurancePremiumsPackage/trunk': authorization failed: Could not authenticate to server: rejected Basic challenge (http://:1818) 5.0.0-M5 [Enter Che version here] Ubuntu 16.04 [Enter OS name and version here] 1.12.1 [Enter your Docker version here docker version on CLI] running from a Che assemble that I built.* [Vagrant, Docker container, server (zip), Bitnami, Yatta, or Codenvy?] Additional information: Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: [Yes/No] Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes
