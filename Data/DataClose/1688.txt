Add ability to see servers in the IDE
kind/enhancement team/pm team/plugin 
With 5.1.0 we removed the "Ops" perspective which was allowing to see the list of all servers. We had, in the Dashboard, a table which allow the user to find those servers, per machine. From UX point of view, the list of all servers should also be available within the IDE, even if the view has been added to UD, it is not convenient for the user to be forced to open the dashboard to get those informations. We received few feedbacks around this trouble and need to draft a specification quickly on these use case. I propose to create a small button in the toolbar, which when clicked it displays a page with all servers (same information as in dashboard). Managing servers, will stay in the dashboard (until we have user request, I don't think it is necessary to provide 2 ways to manage the servers). Che version: 5.1.0/5.2.0
