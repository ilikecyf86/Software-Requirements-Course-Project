Add an ability to match machine configuration to OpenShift container by annotations

Description Now machine configuration is matched to OpenShift container by pod and container names. It means that machine name should be specified in the following format web/main where web is pod name and main is the name of a container in the specified pod. It works fine for openshift recipes but it doesn't work while converting dockerimage recipes to openshift recipes. To solve this problem it is needed to add an ability to match machine from configuration to OpenShift container without the composite machine name. It's proposed to rework OpenShift container to machine configuration in the following way: Get the name of the container. Check if Pod annotations contains annotation org.eclipse.che.{containerName}.machine_name if yes - use the value of this annotations as machine name for this container if not - use the following value {POD_NAME}/{CONTAINER_NAME} as machine name for this container. P.S. Name of org.eclipse.che.{containerName}.machine_name annotation can be discussed and changes.
