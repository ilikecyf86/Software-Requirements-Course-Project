Description MachineConfig object has getAttributes method. But Machine created from this config will have properties field. In fact, these fields have the same responsibility and may contain the same values, like memory limits (see #6555). It can be confused and make an impression that these fields are different. We could rename the field in MachineConfig to properties but to avoid database migration it is better to rename the field in Machine object. So, it is required to rename Machine#getProperties to getAttributes.
