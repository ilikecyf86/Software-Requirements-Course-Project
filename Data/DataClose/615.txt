Move docker container settings applying from DockerMachineStarter
kind/task target/branch team/platform 
Related to SPI branch only. DockerMachineStarter class is old and big and it doesn't follow single responsibility principle. Because of this, it is hard to write tests to it as part of this issue. We need to refactor it and cover its functionality with tests. I suggest moving all docker system settings from this class to InfrastructureProvider class impl. I also suggest that it can be split into several components for work with networks, images, containers.
