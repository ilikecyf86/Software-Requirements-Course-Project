Problem importing OpenShift Git project in Eclipse Che on Codenvy
kind/question 
Hi, I'm getting an internal server error while importing an OpenShift git repo in Eclipse Che (running on Codenvy). I created an SSH-key in Eclipse Che (Preferences > SSH > VCS), and uploaded it to my OpenShift account. Next, I try to import the project, (URL: ssh://<account>@<app-url>.rhcloud.com:/~/git/codenvy.git) but i'm getting: java.lang.IllegalStateException: org.eclipse.che.ide.websocket.rest.exceptions.ServerException: Internal Server Error occurred, error time: 2017-01-12 13:45:41 The SSH key was created for host <app-url>.rhcloud.com, without http or www. Help would be very much appreciated!
