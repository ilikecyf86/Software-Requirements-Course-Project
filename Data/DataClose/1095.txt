kind/bug severity/P1 team/ide sprint/current-sprint status/in-progress 
Reproduction Steps: Create a java workspace Import jboss-eap-quickstarts (https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts) and configure as maven project. Expected behaviour: multi-module project should be recognized Observed behaviour: just folders with pom files instead of maven modules.
