Goal Goal of this issue, is to start prototyping a new concept of Panels. The current panels we are having certain problems that we want to solve, in order to simplify the overall IDE UI and UX. Description One of the key point that we want to improve is the use of the space. User should be able to get an editor which is benefiting from more space. The way our panels are working is a problem. They are keeping space, on the left, the bottom and the right. The panels are always there, it's not possible to completely remove them The panels are duplicating the information (selected pane and title of opened panel). Proposed Solution The proposed solution is: removing the bar in the left/top/right which to display the list of all panels. remove the title bar. use the panel's heading to display the list of all possible panels, using icons. In order to show/hide those new type of panels, two solutions could be studied: Add in Window menu options to Show Projects Explorer, `Show Commands Explorer`` Add a small selector to activate/unactivate the left/bottom/right panels in the menubar
