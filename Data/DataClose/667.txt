The use of GWT `Frame` objects is not compatible with the Keycloak integration
kind/task team/ide 
The use of GWT Frame objects to manage the popup window of both the Java Quick documentation and Java completion documentation is incompatible with the rh-che Keycloak integration that intercepts client-side request submission by overriding the AsyncRequestFactory. The Frame object creates an new html frame in which the client-side Keycloak-related Javascript code cannot be injected. And thus the http requests sent from these frames don't get the right Keycloak authorization token, and are refused on the server-side by the Keycloak authentication filter. The use of GWT Frames should probably be replaced by the use of a FlowPanel (just like in the Orion Editor), whose content would be retrieved through an AsyncRequest.
