che project questions
kind/question 
Hello, in my project, I want to have a java-workspace which would be able to run 2 different java programms at the same time ( one from the workspace , and one custom java programm in parallel ( a profiler jar-programm , which also should run in the same workspace-docker machine ) ) Before implementing that, i would want to ask some questions... My initial idea is to create a custom workspace-stack , where i would use the standard java stack, would git-clone the profiler-jar , and i would have a custom command to run my jar together with the project in the ide... Does this make sence? Or should I rather consider extending the existing java workspace-stack to get my profiler-jar ? Then I would also add a custom command to the existing java workspace-stack. Would that be possible, or is it better to just make custom workspace-stack for that ? Another thing is that option of creating a workspace out of a configuration... I don't quite understand what functionalities i can bring into the configuration... Can i define custom commands there? Is it of any use for me? Where could i read up to this? I know there are many questions, but i am also up for email conversation (can also speak Russian...) Thank You in advance
