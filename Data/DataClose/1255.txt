Support for Multiple LSP Languages Servers per File

Currently, LSP support assumes that only a single language server can be active for any given file. However, this is makes it impossible to do add-on language servers. For an example, think of a linting plugin for typescript for example. Even if the main language server plugin has no support for a particular linting tool, we could make the linting tool contribute diagnostics and code actions to show/fix warnings from the linter. Visual Studio Code, for example, supports this (so it IS possible) and describes a set of rules on how to handle the cases where multiple language servers are claiming responsibility for a file, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#_languages.
