5.0.0-M7 Milestone Plan
kind/planning 
Milestone Overview Visual stack editor SSH improvements Improved Che mount container utility Compose improvements Clarified snapshotting language Upgrade and Migration This is a pre-GA milestone in the new Che 5 stream. Due to a fundamental model change that allows us to deliver multi-machine support, it will only be possible to migrate 4.7.1 workspaces to 5.0.0 at GA (users who wish to try 5.0.0 milestone releases today will have to create new workspaces). Docker Image Tags While 5.0 is pre-GA the :latest tags on our Docker images will continue to point to 4.7.1. We will also create a new 5.0.0-latest tag to make it easier to try each 5.0.0 milestone release. For more information about our development process please see our development process page. Schedule This release will be an Eclipse-signed and marketed release.
