Docker image not updated in an existing workspace
kind/question 
Hello, I'have created a workspace with a custom docker image for my dev machine. However I had to build and deploy in my registry a new latest one to fix an issue. Now I need to update this image in my current workspace but I can't find a way to replace the current version in my workspace by this new one. I have relaunched my workspace but it is not working. I have changed the value in my recipe by a fake one to force the update of the workspace but it was not loaded. Is there a way to update the current docker image used in my workspace ? Reproduction Steps: Create a workspace; Build and deploy a new version; Relaunch the workspace. OS and version: Linux, 5.6.0 Diagnostics: I guess docker images are not checked when the workspace is restarted. It also apply for the workspace recipe.
