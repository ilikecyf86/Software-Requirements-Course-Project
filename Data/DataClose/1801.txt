che-sample-plugin-serverservice-server server not responding
kind/question 
che-sample-plugin-serverservice-server server not responding. che-sample-plugin-serverservice-ide is able to send the request with url Ex: http://172.17.0.1:32778/api/hello/xyz. but getting reply as "There is no any resources matched to request path /hello/xyz" I am referring https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/serverworkspace-access for enabling this plugin. and following bellow procedure. How to test sample-serverservice plugin 1- Link to IDE assembly The plugin-serverservice has both part, an IDE extension and a server extension. You have to introduce the extension as a dependency in /che/assembly/assembly-ide-war/pom.xml. Add: ...
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.che.sample</groupId>
  <artifactId>che-sample-plugin-serverservice-ide</artifactId>
</dependency>
... You can insert the dependency anywhere in the list. After you have inserted it, run mvn sortpom:sort and maven will order the pom.xml for you. 2- Link to WS-Master assembly The plugin-serverservice has a server side part. You have to introduce the extension as a dependency in /che/assembly/assembly-wsmaster-war/pom.xml. Add: ...
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.che.sample</groupId>
  <artifactId>che-sample-plugin-serverservice-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
... You can insert the dependency anywhere in the list. After you have inserted it, run mvn sortpom:sort and maven will order the pom.xml for you. 3- Register dependency to the GWT application Link the GUI extension into the GWT app. You will add an <inherits> tag to the module definition. The name of the GWT extension is derived from the direction + package structure given to the GWT module defined in our extension. In: assembly-ide-war/src/main/resources/org/eclipse/che/ide/IDE.gwt.xml Add: ...
<inherits name='org.eclipse.che.plugin.serverservice.ServerService'/>
... 4- Rebuild Eclipse Che # Create a new Che server web app that includes your Che server extension
cd che/assembly/assembly-wsmaster-war
mvn clean install

# Build a new IDE.war
# This IDE web app will be bundled into the assembly
cd che/assembly/assembly-ide-war
mvn clean install

# Create a new Che assembly that includes all new server- and client-side extensions
cd assembly/assembly-main
mvn clean install
#

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Enable the plugin and build
2. launch eclipse che
3. right click on any projects created in eclipse che -> MyAction 

**Expected behavior:**
 service accepts a String {name} and responds with "Hello {name} !".

**Observed behavior:**
There is no any resources matched to request path /hello/{name}
