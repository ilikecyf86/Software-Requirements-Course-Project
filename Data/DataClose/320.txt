Replace JDT search & AST use with jdt.ls implementation
kind/enhancement sprint/next-sprint team/ide sprint/current-sprint sprint/next-sprint 
The junit and testng plugins in Che use jdt search and AST support to find test cases in code. We need to move this support to jdt.ls. In particular: Design a LSP extension that can fulfil the requirements of the test plugins. Ideally, this would be a start for an LSP extension that can be used from other clients, as well. Implement the API in jdt.ls. We need to coordinate with @fbricon on how to do this: I think this would be a good case for an extension bundle to jdt.ls. If we do an extension, we need to set up a way to build and package the server + extension. Remove jdt from the testing plugin dependencies and use the new API.
