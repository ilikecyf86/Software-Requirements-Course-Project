Failed to change port (regression)
kind/question kind/bug severity/blocker kind/question 
Hi, I do not manage to get che running with a non-default port (9080). I tried on Arch Linux and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. 8080 works but changing the port via export CHE_PORT=9080 does not work. Error message in the terminal where I start docker: INFO: ECLIPSE CHE: Found image eclipse/che-server:5.0.0-latest
INFO: ECLIPSE CHE: Starting container...
INFO: ECLIPSE CHE: Server logs at "docker logs -f che-server"
INFO: ECLIPSE CHE: Server booting...

ERROR: !!!
ERROR:      ECLIPSE CHE: Timeout waiting for server. Run "docker logs che-server" to inspect the issue.
