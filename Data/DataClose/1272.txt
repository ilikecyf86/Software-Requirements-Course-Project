Our search in file widget is looking like this at this moment. Show number of occurences found The provided UX while the user is searching for a text that does not exist in the document is hard to understand: the buttons "next"/"previous" are still active, but they are not doing anything and seems to be bugs there is no information that there are no occurences found. Proposed solution: Results - with number of occurences No results found
