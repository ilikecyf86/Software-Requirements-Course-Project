Reproduction Steps: We used only shell commands before the exec agent. But exec agent bash command. In this way many commands that was written early may not work. It may create many unexpected errors for users of the Codenvy. For example: echo -e '123' > ~/test.txt Expected behavior: should be created file with content like: 123 Observed behavior: we have file with content like: -e 123 Che version: 5.0.0-M9 OS and version: Ubuntu 14.0 TLS Docker version: 1.12.1 Che install: Docker container
