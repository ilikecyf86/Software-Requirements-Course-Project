Installed Docker and Che roughly 2 hours ago. ~(5 a.m CST Feb 27, 2017) Che appears to output the unevaluated argument as the preview URL, while evaluating arguments in the command line. Reproduction Steps: Create node.js workspace with angular-patternfly-starter. Go to Workspaces in the side bar, select the node workspace, then Runtime, then Dev Machine, scroll down to Servers, and click Add to add a new server. Reference = bower-browser port =3010 and protocol = http. Add and Save. Che restarts the workspace. Open the node workspace. Che IDE opens. Use Terminal to install bower-browser globally. sudo npm i bower-browser -g Create a new custom command and name it "bower-browser" with cd ${current.project.path}; bower-browser --silent in the command line box and http://${server.port.3010} in the preview url. note: cd ${current.project.path} . . . works as expected. Save Command and return to IDE. Use the dropdown to select "bower-browser" command and press play. Problem started here. Note: Today, Feb 28, as I went through the steps to clean up formatting and provide more screenshots, this one worked Use the dropdown to select the node template's included command "angular-patternfly-starter: run" and press play. Problem continues. Delete and Recreate workspace with a different name (Node + angular-patternfly-starter). Skip exposing port and adding "bower-browser" command. Go to re-created node workspace and run angular command. Problem persists. OS and version: lsb_release -a No LSB modules are available.
