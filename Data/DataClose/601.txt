WARNING: A connection to https://192.168.42.246:8443/ was leaked. Did you forget to close a response body? To see where this was allocated, set the OkHttpClient logger level to FINE: Logger.getLogger(OkHttpClient.class.getName()).setLevel(Level.FINE);
 Creation of all OpenShift clients placed in try with resources section. So it is needed to investigate why leak is done and fix it.
