auto-expand child folders containing exactly 1 folder like github does when browsing source
kind/enhancement 
when expanding the tree of maven projects things are often very deeply nested. e.g. a simple maven based microservice might have a path of src/main/java/com/acme/foo/bar/something/MyThing.java so thats 8 clicks of the folders to find some actual source code to view. When browsing projects on github its common to automatically open folders which contain only 1 folder. e.g. expand `src`
src/
  main/
  test

expand `src/main`

src/
  main/
   java/
   resources/
  test

expand `src/main/java`

src/
  main/
   java/
    com/
      acme/
       foo/
        bar/
          something/
            MyThing.java
   resources/
  test
 So the above helped speed the user through to the real content (the source code) by using the rule that if a folder containers only 1 child folder then just expand it too. If a project has no tests and no src/main/resources then a single expand of src could list source code.
