Prevent Che start if 'nightly' or 'latest' images are not current.

The nightly and latest images are convenience images desigend to make lives of Che developers easier. However, there are circumstances where changes to the core nightly image for the CLI requires that all of the underlying dependency images are updated with it. Getting the most recent CLI nightly, but leaving the eclipse/che-init:nightly or eclipse/che-server:nightly as older versions can cause problems. A savvy developer can use --pull or --force to forcibly clean this up, but when the errors occur it is not obvious that this is the approach to clean things up. We have tried looking at the created-date within the local image cached on a computer with the matching parameter on DockerHub to see if there is a difference. However, the property from dockerhub only reflects when the image was uploaded and does not match the property on the local image, so these values cannot be used for a meaningful comparison. In doing some tests, it is possible from within the CLI of a Docker container, to check the current date and compare it to the date that certain images were written to disk. We could therefore implement some logic such as: Get the current date of the Docker engine host (Docker VMs can have dates not matching host). On Windows, while today is January 6th, my HyperV VM has the date as December 26th, so we will need to baseline dates. Get the date that the eclipse/che-cli:nightly image was written to disk. If the date the image is written to disk is >24 hours, then we should display the warning message. We could then get the list of dependency images that Che requires (after its been loaded) and then perform a similar check for each one of those. If the dependency images were written to disk >24 hours, we could then detect that other images are older, would they like us to assert a --force where we rmi and pull the image to guarantee it is current. Another variation of this is that any time you run a nightly or latest image we could display a table to stdout that shows all of the images loaded by Che, their name, and how many days it has been since they were written to disk with a hint that --force will repull all images. So this way any time a developer sees that some of their images are >1 day old, they know that any issues could just require a repull. # Get the docker image id
docker image --no-trunc eclipse/che-cli:nightly

# List the particular file and gets it date written to disk
docker run -it -v /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker alpine ls -al /var/lib/docker/image/aufs/imagedb/content/sha256 | grep <image-id> | <cut-to-get-date>
