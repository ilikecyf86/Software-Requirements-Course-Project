There is no modelling tool on Eclipse Che

Hi, Im curious about if modelling resources is planned to Eclipse CHE, we know Microsoft will make UML to be ejected from Microsoft Visual Studio on next version [01] and about bpm there is no plan from Camunda BPM to integrate the web modeller with Eclipse CHE [02], a trend on reactive systems is strong but the Service Component Architecture (SCA) is now almost dead as we can see on internet [03], about BPM there is GPL and ready to use web based BPM editors made by Camunda [04] and Eclipse has the Eclipse Stardust BPM Project also done [05] and the Eclipse Sirius Project that dramatically reduces the time for creating domain-specific modeling tools [06], JBoss, have tools related and is part of Red Hat that is a Eclipse CHE Partner [07] and there is research on modelling for reactive systems [08]. What are the plans for modelling on Eclipse CHE ? CHE is an acronym for what ?
