unexpected grouping of create new project menu items
kind/question 
I have added a new item in che/instance/data/templates/samples.json Its name is Clustering and its category is Blank. It is expected to see the Clustering project in the same Blank group, but it is put in another Blank group. The question is if it is expected behaviour? If so, is there a way to put both blank groups together? OS and version: Che version: 5.0.0 OS and version: Ubuntu 16.04 Docker version: 1.12.5
