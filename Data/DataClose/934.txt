Reproduction Steps: Create a workspace from codenvy/jboss-eap7 image. Clone sample kitchen sink project: https://github.com/codenvy-templates/redhat-kitchensink-webapp.git Run JBoss in debug mode, compile and deploy the project. Open MemberController, and set breakpoints on line: facesContext.addMessage(null, m);
 Connect debugger. Open the application and register a user. When the debugger stops on the first breakpoint use step into. Expected behavior: Current debugger position should be highlighted. Actual behavior: Partially decompiled class is opened, but no highlight is shown.
