I cannot get che to create a stock workspace.
kind/question 
I'm trying to get eclipse/che to run on my Ubuntu laptop. It tells me that /usr/bin/sudo is on an NFS mounted file system with nosuid asserted. This probably a docker problem, but I can't see in the documentation how to fix it. Reproduction Steps: Delete all docker images and containers. This is probably unnecessary. Run the standard eclipse/che command: docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /home2/poppa/tmp/che-data:/data eclipse/che Here, /home2/poppa is a locally mounted SSD. The folder /home2/poppa/tmp/che-data is empty. After the docker command quiesces, and I get my shell prompt back I connect my browser to http://172.17.0.1:8080, which is what the docker command has told me to do. Creating a workspace with a C++ stack gives me the lovely crane animation. After the shell window in the animation page quiesces I'm left with this error message. [dev-machine] [STDERR] sudo: effective uid is not 0, is /usr/bin/sudo on a file system with the 'nosuid' option set or an NFS file system without root privileges? When I do "docker exec -i -t che bash" I see that /usr/bin/sudo is on /conf, and that it in fact has nosuid asserted. I'm not sure how to fix this. I've trawled around in the documentation, and googled with abandon, but I've clearly missed something, perhaps something obvious. Can someone please give me a clue? Thanks. OS and version: Ubuntu 16.10.
