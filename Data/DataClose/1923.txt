Memory settings on workspaces and VMs

With Eclipse Che 5.0.0-latest, it doesn't appear that machines reflect the specified memory settings. This is shown by typing "free" or "grep -i memtotal /proc/meminfo" and the value always returning as ~1GB. This is potentially a serious problem, as it is preventing me from doing things within a workspace that needs more memory than this. (e.g. the JVM will crash during a build of my code when it tries to allocate more memory.) Reproduction Steps: Create a new workspace with any image, and set the memory size to 2GB or greater. Start the workspace. Once the terminal is available, enter "grep -i memtotal /proc/meminfo" Expected behavior: The expected behavior is that the output of the command given in step 3 should report the value specified as the memory of the machine during workspace configuration. Observed behavior: The output of the command is always ~1GB which does not reflect the workspace configuration.
