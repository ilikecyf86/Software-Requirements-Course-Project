Allow a user's SSH keys to be shared with the git client in the terminal
kind/enhancement severity/P2 
It would be helpful if the git client used in the workspace machine could pull the SSH info that's configured in Profile > Preferences and used by the JGit implementation in Che. Perhaps if the path to the SSH key defined in Preferences was copied to .ssh/config the git command line could pick up the same key.
