Adding authentification - is a very frequent request from Eclipse Che community. We think that Keycloak is a rich framework that can provide many interesting features http://www.keycloak.org/about.html From a technical perspective, it would be a separate assembly inside of Che. We don't want to remove an ability for plugin developers to have an easy and simple assembly without authentification and any heavy components for easy testing of their work. We might reuse the same approach like we did with "single port" feature. When changing some specific parameter on configuration will change the number of containers that would be running. In this case, Keycloak will be running as a separate container.
