Cannot start multiple Eclipse Che containers on the same server due (maybe) to ports overlapping.
kind/question 
After the new Eclipse Che update I just wanted to test out multiple Eclipse Che containers on the same server. The problem is that whenever I start a new container on a different port, the container on the first port receives a SIGTERM. ("Received SIGTERM. Stopping Che server running on localhost:$port... A valid shutdown command was received via the shutdown port"). This container is then shut down and removed. Here's the command I'm using: docker run -it --rm -e CHE_PORT=$PORT -v $pathtodata:/data -v $pathtoche:/che -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock eclipse/che:latest start I use different $pathtodata and $pathtoche folders for each new Che container I try to run. The new instance always starts successfully and is mapped to the correct port. HOWEVER, what I think is the issue is that the ports of the che container always include both the port I specified as well as the 8000 and 8080 ports. For example, after I started a container on port 8181: Container: che-8181 Ports: 8000/tcp, 8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8181->8181/tcp and when I start a container on port 8080: Container: che-8080 Ports: 8000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp Why are 8000 and 8080 included here? I can include the log but I don't think it contains any pertinent information besides the two line shutdown protocol mentioned above.
