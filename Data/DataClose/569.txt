Opening a file using Assistant > Navigate to File with double-clicking creates multiple tabs

If you use the Assistant > Navigate to File with the mouse, it create multiple tabs of the same file. Reproduction Steps: I can reproduce this locally on my own instance of Che. But, this is reproducible on the instance that is running on CodeEnvy as well so I am using those steps here. Create a new workspace in Che. Use the che-in-che project. Wait for the project to be ready. Use Assistant > Navigate to File to open the XMLTreeTest.java file. I used my mouse to double-click the option and select it. This seems to be the trigger since using just the keyboard and hitting enter doesn't produce the issue. Notice that it opens up multiple tabs with the contents of the file. See the following gif for the issue OS and version: OS X on Chrome.
