kind/task target/branch team/platform status/in-progress status/in-progress 
For strategy when one OpenShift project is mapped to one che workspace we do cleanup in such way: when the workspace is removed then we remove the OpenShift project with all the data. For the strategy when one OpenShift project is mapped to many che workspaces we need to implement a cleanup mechanism which will remove all the data related to the removed workspace including the subpaths in PVC.
