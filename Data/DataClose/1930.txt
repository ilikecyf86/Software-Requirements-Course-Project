Electron Client should support upgrades
kind/enhancement sprint/next-sprint team/ide sprint/next-sprint 
We would need a way to support upgrades. If a user gets a new version of the .exe installation and already has an electron client installed, how would the upgrade process work? We should also verify that electron clients can be installed and run in Windows folders with spaces in the names. We should also test this on Windows 7.
