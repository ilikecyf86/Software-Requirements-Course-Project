After pushing changes onto the remote repository, the git status color used for the committed is incorrect. Reproduction Steps: 1- Do some changes in existing files 2- Create a new file and include content in it 3- Commit and push to the remote repository Expected Output: The filename color used in the editor's bar is "normal" = gray after the changes have been pushed - exactly as in the project explorer. Current Output: The filename color is green, while in the git status that file is clean and the color is "normal" in the project explorer.
