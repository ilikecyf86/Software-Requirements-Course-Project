[Regression] Cursor returns to top of file
kind/bug severity/P1 
As per previous issues #5850 #6043, since Che 5.19 we are seeing the cursor jump to the top of the file when switching away from the file and back. To reproduce, open a two files, make a change in one and leave the cursor at that position. Switch to the first file, then switch back - the cursor returns to the top of the file.
