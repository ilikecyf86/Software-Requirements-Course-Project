Would like word wrap toggle for the IDE editor. If possible have word wrap initially set to true/false for new editor tabs with default wrap set by profile > preferences > editor. Toggling the word wrap per tab should be done via a new UI/IDE menu item edit > word wrap. Implementation: From my research the plugin language servers should allow for this with <g:Label ui:field="labelUrlError" width="100%" wordWrap="true"/> indicated in docs page https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/plugins/project-types/index.html. If it's easier we could do this through orion editor also. Almost all editors have word wrap feature. Labelled this P2 because the IDE editor is really hard to use other wise for documents with long lines such a markdown files. Reproduction Steps: Edit markdown file. Difficult to edit long paragraph with no breaks. Expected behavior: Option to have word wrap in editor. Observed behavior: Single line with horizontal scroll bar.
