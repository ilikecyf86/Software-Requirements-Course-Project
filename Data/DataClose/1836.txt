I created this issue simply to say, maybe the auto saving on IDE should be an option for 2 main reasons for me : First reasons is on auto-compiler (like JS webpack and other) works on watch files, so anytime a file change, a build is launched, the IDE takes 2 sec before running it, the auto-compiler goes for 5sec.. Second reason, whenever you close a file, the IDE saves the file, meaning when you run git checkout, close the file (it didn't update it on IDE) so the file gets erased by the old version. Reproduction Steps: First reasons is on auto-compiler (like JS webpack and other) works on watch files File changes (2s) Auto-compiler (5s) => 5s is not that bad, but it could be worst, use JAVA File changes (you forgot something... a dash...) Auto-compiler (5s) Second reason, closing a file Open a file (./index.js) Run git checkout Git status => nothing close the file git status => shows index.js Expected behavior: First reason, manual save runs the compiler. Second reason, the file should update on the IDE. Observed behavior: Second reason, the file tab doesn't update on the IDE and overwrite the system file.
