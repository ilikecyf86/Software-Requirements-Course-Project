Description On this moment the test has many unnecessary steps: we use push, add to index, remove operation from IDE UI for checking just pull operation. This add unstable in the test and add many extra - steps. Also this make wrong of the test-logic. As possible solution we can use kohsuke Github library for performing operations that are not the main goal of the test (push, add to index and etc., commit from UI). Also important part of this issue if it will work fine - we can apply this solution for other tests. In this way we'll increase stability and reduce time of passing git selenium tests OS and version: Fedora25, chrome browser, IDE-5.6.0-M1
