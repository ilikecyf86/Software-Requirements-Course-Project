I create new folder in a plain java project and configure it as source folder. When I try to move a java file into new source folder, it is not present into refactor move form. Reproduction Steps: Open a plain java project in the IDE(e.g. https://github.com/idexmai1/plainJavaProject.git). Create a new folder and configure it as source folder. Try to move a java file into new source folder. Expected behavior: New source folder should be displayed and available for refactor move. Observed behavior: New source folder is not present into refactor move form. Che version: 5.0.0-M9 OS and version: Ubuntu 14.04 Docker version: 1.12 Che install: Docker container Additional information: Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: [Yes] See the attachment:
