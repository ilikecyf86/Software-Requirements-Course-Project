Java language server not available
kind/question 
After creating a che docker container and adding a sample Java project (codenvy/ubuntu_jdk8) no Java language server is available. DEV-MACHINE agents include C#, JSON, and PHP (all off) but no Java. Could you please explain how I can install and/or make this available? Thank you! Reproduction Steps: I created a che container as per the insructions here: http://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/setup/docker/index.html I.e. eclipse/che-server:5.0.0-latest I created a new project based on codenvy/ubuntu_jdk8 OS and version: 16.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-72-generic x86_64)
