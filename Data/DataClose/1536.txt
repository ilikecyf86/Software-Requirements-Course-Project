Serialize machine required fields as docker container labels

This is a very first step to achive workspace runtimes recovery. Basically each time docker container is created machine servers are stored as labels, which allows to recover this data in future. The other machine mandatory data such as machine id
machine name
machine owner
workspace id
environment name
 should be also serialized as container labels, proposed format is: "che:env_name": "wksp-lz1b",
"che:id": "machinep91hshmqt17bi7lp",
"che:name": "dev-machine",
"che:owner": "che",
"che:workspace_id": "workspaceos6k0l3pz89ufi2z",
"che:server:22/tcp:ref": "ssh",
"che:server:4401/tcp:path": "/api",
"che:server:4401/tcp:protocol": "http",
"che:server:4401/tcp:ref": "wsagent",
"che:server:4411/tcp:protocol": "http",
"che:server:4411/tcp:ref": "terminal",
"che:server:8000:protocol": "http",
"che:server:8000:ref": "tomcat8-debug",
"che:server:8080:protocol": "http",
"che:server:8080:ref": "tomcat8",
"che:server:9876:protocol": "http",
"che:server:9876:ref": "codeserver"
