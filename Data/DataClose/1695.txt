When running che sync via: docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v ~/Projects/che:/data -v ~/Projects/sync:/sync eclipse/che sync myworkspace it goes for a while (couple minutes) then terminates with: INFO: INFO: (che mount): Mounting user@172.17.0.1:/projects with SSHFS INFO: INFO: (che mount): Successfully mounted user@172.17.0.1:/projects (32797) INFO: INFO: (che mount): Initial sync...Please wait. !!! !!! ERROR: Fatal error occurred (1) !!! The folder being synced does have a large number of files in it (it's a Drupal installation). Seemed to work only when I had a small number of files. The sync does appear to finish. But it doesn't keep running to sync the files. Any way to determine more specific error information? The basic message isn't very useful.
