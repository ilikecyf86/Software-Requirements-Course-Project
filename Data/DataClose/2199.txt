Let users configure the "Z" flag when mouting a volume
kind/enhancement 
This is a feature that has been discussed with @eivantsov last week and should help solving some problems that customers may have with volumes mounted with the Z flag. Currently wsmaster add the Z flag when mounting volumes. For example this command is used to start a java workspace: docker create -v /home/user/che/workspaces/wksp-sr4g:/projects:Z ... docker.io/codenvy/ubuntu_jdk8 The problem with the Z flag is that there are situations where the container creation will fail if it's set. This is currently the case of CentOS 7 with SELinux activated for example. The proposed solution is to introduce a new property (e.g. machine.docker.use_zflag) to allow users to disable the Z flag. The default behaviour will be to set the Z flag.
