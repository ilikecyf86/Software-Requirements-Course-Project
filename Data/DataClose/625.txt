Hello I have upgrade Che to 5.15 this week. Since this upgrade, my workspaces lost the connection with the Che server after a short (several minutes) period on inactivity. I need to start again the workspace. Che Server is local to my dev machine, no http proxy. Any feedback about this behaviour? Many thanks. Laurent
