Today our pull request panel operations only work with a public GitHub repo. The same operations should be possible with a BitBucket or BitBucket Server (previously known as Stash) repo. This task is to estimate the number of sprints needed to implement all the same pull request operations with BitBucket and BitBucket Server (public and private) repos.
