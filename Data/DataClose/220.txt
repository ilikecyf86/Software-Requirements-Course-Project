Che Dashboard doesn't load on port 8081 when using the server name instead of IP address
kind/question 
Description I try to run the single user Che 5.19.0 on port 8081. But the dashboard doesn't come up if I use the DNS name of the server (my.server.at.my.company) instead of the IP address. The same works with 8080 or 8082 or any other port I tried. Reproduction Steps Basically I run the below with an empty data area: docker run -it --rm -e CHE_PORT=8081 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /usr/local/data:/data eclipse/che:5.19.0 init
docker run -it --rm -e CHE_PORT=8081 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /usr/local/data:/data eclipse/che:5.19.0 start
 The output tells me that the server is available at http://myipaddress:8081. (numerical ip address, e.g. 1.2.3.4) If I use this URL everything is fine. If I however use the DNS name of my server http://my.server.at.my.company:8081 the dashboard never finishes loading. It shows the "Create Workspace" Button but continues to indicate loading and the normal start screen to select a stack doesn't come up. If I do the same with other ports (8080, 8082, ...) it works. OS and version: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.3 (Maipo) Operated behind company proxy Diagnostics: In the browser it looks like it starts to go wrong with the call to http://myipaddress:8081/api/. When it works, this call returns a JSON with the list of resources. In the broken case, it returns this: /che-parent/assembly/assembly-ide-war/src/main/webapp/_app/IDE.html (the file contents).
