We need to have next features when running selenium tests on Multi User Che with --multiuser parameter: To have --multiuser parameter in sample commands in test output like the follow: [TEST] Try rerun all tests:
[TEST] 	/home/ndp/projects/che/selenium/che-selenium-test/selenium-tests.sh   --threads=2 -Mlocal --failed-tests
[TEST] 	/home/ndp/projects/che/selenium/che-selenium-test/selenium-tests.sh   --threads=2 -Mgrid --failed-tests
[TEST]
[TEST] Or run them one by one:
[TEST] 	/home/ndp/projects/che/selenium/che-selenium-test/selenium-tests.sh   -Mlocal --test=org.eclipse.che.selenium.assistant.CheckFindActionFeatureInCheTest
[TEST] 	/home/ndp/projects/che/selenium/che-selenium-test/selenium-tests.sh   -Mlocal --test=org.eclipse.che.selenium.dashboard.CreateAndDeleteProjectsTest
