Now get workspaces API /api/workspace returns list of all users workspaces. Each workspace in this list contains runtime object. Each runtime object contains description of all docker machines in a workspace. This means that on each request to get list of workspaces we make big amount of requests to different backends (RDB, Docker API). We should remove runtime description from workspaces from this request. If client needs runtime description it should call get workspace API /api/workspace/<ws-id>.
