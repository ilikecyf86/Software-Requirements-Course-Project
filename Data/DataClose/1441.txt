Setup websocket JSONRPC API endpoint on master

We use websocket JSONRPC communication between IDE client and ws-agent. We consider it as much more modern and handy then the previous websocket communication protocol. So it was decided to use it in #4099. Dod for this issue is to setup websocket JSONRPC endpoint on master to allow communication of master as JSONRPC server. It doesn't have to neither handle any new messages nor support messages from old websocket communication protocol. For resolve this task need to: replace org.eclipse.che.api.workspace.server.event.WorkspaceMessenger, org.eclipse.che.api.machine.server.event.MachineProcessMessenger, org.eclipse.che.api.machine.server.event.MachineStateMessenger with org.eclipse.che.api.core.websocket.impl.BasicWebSocketMessageTransmitter on server side; avoid using org.eclipse.che.ide.websocket.MessageBusImpl
