kind/bug severity/P1 team/ide status/in-progress status/code-review status/in-progress status/code-review 
`Reproduction Steps: Go to codenvy.io Create blank workspace Enable Python language server Open workspace Create sample project web-python2.7-simple Open main.py Copy-past text several times up to 400-500 lines See that validations stops working The same behavior has seen on Che v.5.16.0 and for JSON language server too. I guess this problem occurs for all LS due to the same mechanize somewhere deep inside plugin-languageserver or on the server side.
