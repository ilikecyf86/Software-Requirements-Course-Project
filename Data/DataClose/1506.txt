Workspace container RAM requirements
kind/question 
Hi, I'm looking for ways to reduce (dramatically) the size of each workspace RAM consumption. Based on your docs, it should be minimally 256MB - I assume you refer to set JAVA -Xmx256m no less. If you measure RSS (Resident Set Size) on the Linux level, it usually is more (by far - see for example here: http://trustmeiamadeveloper.com/2016/03/18/where-is-my-memory-java/) In reality the out-of-the-box installation uses -Xmx2048: memory actually used, after just creating a new workspace is close to 1GB RSS how can I change the -Xmx settings? Is there a way to use Jetty:alpine instead of tomcat for the workspace agent? my simple measurements show 100MB less on RSS for an "empty" jetty vs. "empty" tomcat Thanks, Ariel Reproduction Steps: OS and version: Docker, Che 5 - latest Diagnostics:
