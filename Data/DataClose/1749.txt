Support: Help Getting Che Master & Agent To Connect
kind/question 
I'm trying to override the api URL in che to use my host ip address (eventually host dns name). I'm trying to run che behind an nginx reverse proxy. It is partially successful, but the api calls are failing to get the stack icons. I followed the directions in the overriding internals and made every effort to override the HOSTNAME and IP properties with that of my compute instance here represented as (IP): #!/bin/sh docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name che --restart always -e CHE_IP=(IP) -e CHE_HOSTNAME=(IP) -e CHE_HOST_IP=(IP) -e CHE_DOCKER_MACHINE_HOST=(IP) -e CHE_CONF_FOLDER=/conf -v /home/johnlabarge/che:/conf -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock eclipse/che-server:5.0.0-latest In my che.properties (whose directory I verified is mounted correctly) I overrode: che.api=http://(IP)/wsmaster/api che.workspace.che_server_endpoint=http://(IP)/wsmaster/api In the browser my container images are broken and I see the following errors: 127.0.0.1:8080/wsmaster/api/stack/php-default/icon:1 GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/wsmaster/api/stack/php-default/icon net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED Che version: 5.0.0-latest OS and version: Distributor ID: Debian Description: Debian GNU/Linux 8.6 (jessie) Release: 8.6 Codename: jessie Docker version: Client: Version: 1.12.6 API version: 1.24 Go version: go1.6.4 Git commit: 78d1802 Built: Tue Jan 10 20:17:57 2017 OS/Arch: linux/amd64 Server: Version: 1.12.6 API version: 1.24 Go version: go1.6.4 Git commit: 78d1802 Built: Tue Jan 10 20:17:57 2017 OS/Arch: linux/amd64
