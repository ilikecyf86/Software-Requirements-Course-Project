Investigate how CHE server can be configured in case of deploy on OCP
kind/task sprint/current-sprint team/production status/analyzing 
Today we have many issues with deploy_che.sh and che-openshift.yml due to lots of sed commands that really hard to support and also we are not able to change all CHE configuration parameters on OCP. For example just to add ability to configure oAuth for CHE I used to extend deploy script https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/7212/files which is really bad thing to do if we are talking about whole set of CHE configurations that way does not work at all. So the idea is try to generate che-openshift.yml from a puppet template and make deploy script really simple. We decided that using CHE CLI for that will make this very complex and non trivial in support, So I will try to get rid of seds and allow to set any config for CHE server with minimum effort for a user
