Che tries to connect to internet to retrieve the stack's image in offline mode.
kind/question 
I've installed Che in offline mode by the following instruction. But when I want to create a new workspace, it tries to connect to internet to retrieve the stack's image and launching it. While connected to the Internet, I've downloaded Cheâ€™s Docker images. docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock eclipse/che:5.8.0 offline This command downloaded the following files: alpine:3.4.tar docker_compose:1.8.1.tar eclipse_che:5.8.0.tar eclipse_che-action:5.8.0.tar eclipse_che-init:5.8.0.tar eclipse_che-server:5.8.0.tar Then I copied these files to an Internetless server and started Che in offline mode by the following commands: docker load < /tmp/offline/eclipse_che:5.8.0.tar docker run -it --rm -e -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp/offline:/data/backup eclipse/che:5.8.0 start --offline I have run all commands with root user. Any advice would be greatly appreciated OS and version: Description: Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS Release: 16.04 Codename: xenial
