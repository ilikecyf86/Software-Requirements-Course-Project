Codenvy and custom plugins
kind/question 
This is a question about contributing custom plugins into Codenvy. I have created some plugins which build fine with Che, but I’m not certain how to build them into Codenvy. My plugins: org.eclipse.che.plugin:che-plugin-servicedev-ide org.eclipse.che.plugin:che-plugin-servicedev-server org.eclipse.che.plugin:che-plugin-servicedev-shared I believe I put them where they need to go and put the dependencies in the right places (modeled after plugin-java). I am getting the following error when building: [ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project onpremises-ide-compiling-war-ide: Could not resolve dependencies for project com.codenvy.onpremises:onpremises-ide-compiling-war-ide:war:5.2.0-SNAPSHOT: The following artifacts could not be resolved: org.eclipse.che.plugin:che-plugin-servicedev-ide:jar:5.2.0-SNAPSHOT, org.eclipse.che.plugin:che-plugin-servicedev-shared:jar:5.2.0-SNAPSHOT: Failure to find org.eclipse.che.plugin:che-plugin-servicedev-ide:jar:5.2.0-SNAPSHOT in https://maven.codenvycorp.com/content/groups/public/ was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of codenvy-public-repo has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1] Of course, my plugins will not be in https://maven.codenvycorp.com/content/groups/public/. I guess I can put them into my local Maven repository /home/user/.m2 …, but I don’t know how to build them into jars within Codenvy. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.
