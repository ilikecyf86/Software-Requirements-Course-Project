kind/bug severity/P2 status/open-for-dev team/enterprise sprint/next-sprint 
Reproduction Steps: Import next project as maven: java-ext-class-project.zip . Context Menu -> Maven->reimport. Edit->RemoteDebug Configuration -> set default configuration for java. Open SimpleLogger.class. Open Run next command: mvn -f ${current.project.path} clean install && java -jar -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000 ${current.project.path}/target/java-with-external-libs-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar Set breakpointin 13. Run->debug->connection to debug. Wait active state breakpoint with highlighting current string Launch Step Into button Expected result : Should be open Logger external class, the content filterAndLog_1(FQCN, null, Level.INFO, format, arg, null); should be highlighted in red color. Actual result: The breakpoint is not set in the class properly. I think it happens because when debugger try to set breakpoint unexpectedly performs 'Download Source' operation. After that, the content is updated and breakpoint position became broken.
