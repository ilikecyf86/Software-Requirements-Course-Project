Workspace storage location not inherited from server container
kind/question 
I'm following the procedure outlined here: https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/usage-docker for using docker containers and che-launcher. I pass CHE_DATA environment variable to che-launcher for host-based workspace storage. My command is this: docker run --rm -t -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \ -e CHE_DATA=/my/data/che-data \ -e CHE_HOST_IP=10.2.2.2 \ eclipse/che-launcher:5.0.0-latest start The directory structure appears to be created correctly at /my/data/che-data within che-server, and indeed I can see from "docker inspect" a bind for "/my/data/dir:/data:Z" for the server container. However, when I create a workspace with a demo project, its project storage still goes to /data. Looking at "docker inspect" for the workspace container, I can see a bind for "/data/workspaces/wksp-zodo:/projects:Z". And of course the projects for that workspace do end up in /data when the workspace is shut down. I would expect them to be stored in /my/data/che-data with the rest of the data. Evidently the docker volume mapping from server -> workspace is not being made properly. Che version: 5.0.0-latest OS and version: Ubuntu 16.04 Docker version: 1.12.1 Che install: Docker container che-launcher 5.0.0-latest
