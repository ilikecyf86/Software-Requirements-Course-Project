Unify the way how che-server image is configured
kind/task target/che6 
Description In Che 6 we introducing infrastructures as a first level citizens. It happened that easiest and most widely way to provide configuration become an environment variables. In our configuration framework, we have this support. The sequence are following : che.properties inside of war. che.properties in CHE_CONF dir System variables Environment variables. In times of Che5 where docker was our primary target we used che.properties https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/assembly/assembly-main/src/assembly/assembly.xml#L162-L165 and put it outside of war. Also, we doing some other actions with this file in https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/dockerfiles/che/entrypoint.sh#L247-L292 this way make a couple of difficulties. Not all configuration parameters of che-dev image is configured with environment variables Changes default values in che.properties inside of war have no effect of existed installation. It brings difficulties for developers in understating where actually properties are located. It revert's upside down original concept of default values packaged in war and managed by authors of code.
