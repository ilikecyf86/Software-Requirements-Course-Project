Adding dependency to IDE plugin
kind/question 
I have added following dependency to my IDE plugin , but I am not able to compile it , is this because of some dependency restrictions? <dependency>
            <groupId>com.googlecode.gwt-charts</groupId>
            <artifactId>gwt-charts</artifactId>
            <version>0.9.10</version>
        </dependency>
