Including an equals sign in a Dockerfile ENV instruction in the stack authoring editor munges the output of recipe.content. The resulting workspace fails to build and Che outputs irrelevant errors. Reproduction Steps: Starting with Workspaces > Add Workspace > Runtime > Stack authoring and using the following as a recipe definition: FROM whatever ENV key=value Notice the output of Recipe > Show: FROM whatever ENV key valu ENV key value Flip over to the Workspace Config tab and notice the environments.<workspace-name>.recipe.content property: "content": "FROM whatever\nENV key valu\nENV key value\n", NOTE: The output is equally munged when using the stack authoring editor from Dashboard > Create Workspace. However, there's no way to see the output from that UI since there's no way to view the workspace config and it lacks a Show Recipe feature. Still, the workspace fails with an irrelevant error. Workaround: Use the alternative Dockerfile syntax which omits the equals sign: ENV key value Use a remote Dockerfile recipe which is not affected OS and version: Linux 3.16.0-38-generic #52~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri May 8 09:43:57 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Version :5.5.0 Revision :69cf9f5528540c35Build Time :2017-03-15 15:17:08
