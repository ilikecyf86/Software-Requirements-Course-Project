Error creating new project
kind/question 
Whenever a try to create a new project i get the following error: Internal Server Error: <REPO_URL> : cannot open git-upload-pack REPO_URL is the url from where Che tries to clone the projects. All i'm doing is: Go to Dashboard -> Select New fom blank, template, or sample project -> Select the Java Ready-to-go Stack(for example) -> leave the options how it is and then i click on Create. In Creating Project Phase i get the above error. What i can see from google is this is an ssl verification that fails. How can i disable it when che tries to download some repo? thanks for your help :) Che version: 4.7.2 OS and version: Linux Mint 18 ( Sarah) Docker version: 1.11.2 Che install: Container
