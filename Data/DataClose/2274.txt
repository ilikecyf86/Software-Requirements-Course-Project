Install che behind specific Port range to communicate
kind/question 
Hello all, I want to install eclipse che in our company. We have a tansparent proxy and a firewall. Our firewall expert opens a port range rom 8080 until 8999 for my project (eclipse che) from our server network to the client network. I've install a debian system with jessie and docker version 12.x.x. I've configured the port range for docker in the "/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range" file. With these port range, I've download the eclipse che Codenvy software (latest version) I've configured the proxy in docker settings. I've started the server with: docker run --rm -t -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -e CHE_HOST_IP=10.0.xxx.153 eclipse/che start //xxx stays for sequence of numbers Now, I can connect to my eclipse che (server network) with my notebook browser (client network) with http://10.0.xxx.153:8080/ I can created a workspace and connect to him. I want to crate a sample project and I receive the message, that my che can't connect to github.com. But why? So, my problem is, that my docker communicate about the right ports (8080 - 8999) to our client network, but my workspace (all workspaces) want to communicate about the higher ports (35**** - 65573). So what can I do, that I run sample project from github. If you need any information or you have questions about my discription, don't hasitate to contact me. Thank you very much for your help!! Best regards,
