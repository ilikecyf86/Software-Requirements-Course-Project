Permission denied for che-websocket-terminal after building Che on Windows
kind/question 
After upgrading sources to 5.0.0-M9 and rebuilding Che on Windows I can not start any new workspace as I always get the following error: Reproduction Steps: Build Che (on Windows) with the use of the latest 5.0.0-M9 sources Run Che and try to create any new workspace with the use of one of "Ready-to-go" stacks Expected behavior: Workspace should start without a problem :) Observed behavior: As described at the beginning. Che version: 5.0.0-M9 OS and version: Windows 10 Docker version: 1.12.3 (I am using Docker for Windows with Hyper-V support, anyway the problem is also the same while using Docker Toolbox) Che install: Local build Additional information: Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: Yes Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes After some digging I think that the problem is probably related to new 'exec-agent'. While building 'exec-agent' on Windows all of the 'che-websocket-terminal' files that were built by GO are having 644 permission flags in my particular case. As a workaround I have added <fileMode>0755</fileMode> entry in 'assembly.xml' file (first fileSet) from 'exec-agent' and it helped. Anyway I am not sure whether it is more related to my Win setup or it is more general problem.
