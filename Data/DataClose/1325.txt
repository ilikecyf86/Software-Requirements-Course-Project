Adding host entry to che container
kind/question 
Hi I am trying to run che with this command docker run -it --add-host foo:176.2.3.1 --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp/chedata:/data eclipse/che start che starts good, but I was expecting 176.2.3.1 foo to be added to the /etc/hosts of the che container, but it is not happening. Any idea why? thanks
