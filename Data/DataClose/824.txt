Implement mechanism for providing unique ids for json rpc clients

Now id is a part of endpoint address and generation of it is a responsibility of the client. But there is not a way to guarantee that different clients generate a unique identifier. There are few ways to be sure that different clients use unique identifier: Implement providing identifier from a server when the connection is set up and implement a mechanism to reconnect as existing client. Something like: Client connects to a websocket endpoint; Server establishes connection and send generated id to client; Client receives id and store it; If the connection is interrupted, client reconnects and somehow specify its identifier (like query param or by sending a special message). Implement rest service that will generate a unique identifier for clients. Then: Client request identifier for itself and store it; Client constructs endpoint path by adding received identifier; Also we can investigate if we could robustly identify client without any interaction with him, for example getting client's unique identifier from websocket connection session or something like that. Second way looks like easier to implement but there still is no guarantee that clients will use implemented service for generation of identifiers. And the second approach force clients to use an identifier on another hand first approach provides identifiers just like additional functionality for reconnection and clients don't have to use it.
