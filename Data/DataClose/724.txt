SPI 6 Docker implementation
kind/epic team/platform 
The goal is to create (local) Docker implementation of SPI #4736 (partially adopt, partially rewrite v5 one) As for the time being it is already implemented and requires improvements only, I just would like to decouple Docker issues from SPI issue (which contains big amount of sub-tasks already) itself to make it clear. Cleanup Docker implementation #5095 Make Docker SPI implementation pass events to master that should pass it to clients #5125 Implement channel with infrastructure specific messages/logs in Docker SPI implementation. #5102 Revise Docker infrastructure implementation code to find what should be fixed or implemented #5423 Stop Docker runtime in case of appearance of internal error like OOM #5419 Serialize machine required fields as docker container labels #4104 Make Docker SPI impl work on Mac and Windows again #5099 (should be fixed by URLRewriter, close) Implement Runtimes restoring in Docker implementation. #5097 Implement workspace start interruption for Docker backend #5644 Implement URLRewriter for Docker infrastructure #5684 Move docker container settings applying from DockerMachineStarter #5871 Implement Environment estimation in Docker SPI implementation. #5096 (blocked by refactoring of estimation place) In progress TODO (important for this epic, please do not change w/o discussion) Move docker infrastructure related code from docker-plugin to docker infrastructure #6404 Test docker infrastructure #5575
