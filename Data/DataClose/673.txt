Goals With the new layout of Che 6, we want to simplify the experience to get a new tab inside of the pane. Today, user has the ability to get multiple tabs into process and editor panes. Requirements In the panes where it's possible to get multiple panes, we will add a "+" button. When clicked, this "+" button will allow to display a menu, where the user can select what the tab will be for. For Processes pane: For Editor pane: When the user will click on "+" button, it will allow to create a new file (it will propose the choices that we have from the toolbar today which is the same as right click "New File")
