Enhancements for workspace create REST service to support additional parameters
kind/question kind/enhancement 
It would be useful for the workspace creation REST service to support setting up a new workspace with some additional parameters, such as open files, cursor positions in files, breakpoints, stacktrace info, etc. This would enable a developer to create a new workspace with the required state for working on an issue or feature request with these additional parameter values being provided by the issue tracking system. This enhancement would require some changes to org.eclipse.che.api.workspace.server.WorkspaceService (che-core-api-workspace), probably in the org.eclipse.che.api.workspace.shared.dto.ProjectConfigDTO class, and changes in WorkspaceManager to support the extra params.
