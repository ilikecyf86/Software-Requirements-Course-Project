Hello, I installed Che on a KVM Ubuntu 16.04 machine, inside docker container. No problem at the beginning, but after a few days, Che becomes slow and even does not respond anymore. A message "Updating File" is shown. The container contains one Workspace with Meteor, with one meteor project running inside. The biggest files are CSS files of 3-4 Mb Reproduction Steps: Create Meteor Workspace according to procedure described here : https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/get-started-with-meteor Run meteor project Change any file Let system sit for a couple days Observed behavior: Freezes and browser no longer responding Che version: 5.0.0. Latest OS and version: Ubuntu 16.04 on KVM Docker version: Docker version 1.12.3, build 6b644ec Che install: Docker Container Additional information: KVM Machine has GB RAM, 6 GB used. CPU is between 1-2% only.
