Investigate a possibility of using a Docker flow in Che
kind/enhancement status/analyzing team/enterprise 
Developers are being "programmed" to appreciate that for a project, the Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml will be in the root of the repository. Developers expect as part of their workflow to "git clone ; docker-compose up -d" So, in our world, the developer will still need a workspace, but they will expect to keep using the development workflow that is familiar to them. This means that: They believe that (most) everything they need is in the repository already. The repository will have the files necessary to bootstrap the workspace's runtime as a combination of an already existing Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml ... optionally combined with additional info from within a Chefile. The workspace (after bootstrapped), would have 1..n projects which have the source code from the repository in it, and that source code would have Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml. Developers inside of the workspace will optionally be able to use their expected workflow "docker run " ... or "docker-compose up". These commands will know how to volume mount the source code that is in the workspace. If a repo that is to be used to bootstrap a workspace has a Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and / or Chefile, then a "workspace created from repo" should have a bootstrapping algorithm around: verify SSH / oAuth check repo for necessary Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, Chefile define workspace runtime through some precedent sequence start workspace create initial project from source repo. We just need to embrace this workflow INSIDE of che - so that it's honored in the UD and other places where you create new workspaces.
