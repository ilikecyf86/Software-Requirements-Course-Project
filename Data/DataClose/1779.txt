Use consistent versions of Che images used between nightly/latest
kind/enhancement status/code-review status/code-review 
Utilities images are always pointing to "nightly" images. #3646 (review) So that when you start a command using the eclipse/che:latest, it retrieves images that are nightly. As a user, it feels strange and confusing. Would be expected that if starting with latest it uses always latest images, and if starting with nightly it uses always nightly images. This will make debugging scenarios for users and customers hard to reproduce. Che version: 5.0.0, 5.0.1
