Python language server - offline mode
kind/question 
Should the Python language server work in offline mode? My question may be related to #3809 I'm trying to upgrade from 5.11 to 5.15 mainly for the python language server. I'm running this in offline mode. When I create a new workspace, Python Defauly Python Stack with Python 3.5.1, pip 8.1.1 the work space starts with errors "missing /home/user/.cache/pip". Ignoring the error, I create a new project and double click on the "main.py" file what was created for me. This throws the error, Can't start language server process. Got error: /home/user/che/ls-python/launch.sh: 1: /home/user/che/ls-python/launch.sh: pyls: not found the launch.sh file does exsist and as expected, it contains "pyls". running pyls from the command line yields "bash: pyls: command not found". At thins point, I'm assuming that Che needs to download some files to get the language server running but that's as far as I've gotten.
