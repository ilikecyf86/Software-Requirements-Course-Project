the commands from samples.json don't appear
kind/question 
I have created a blank workspace and in it I have created an angular-patternfly-starter project (from the sample group). It appeared in the project explorer, but the commands assigned for this sample "commands": [
      {
        "name": "install dependencies",
        "type": "custom",
        "commandLine": "cd ${current.project.path} && npm install --no-bin-links && bower install",
        "attributes": {
          "previewUrl": ""
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "run",
        "type": "custom",
        "commandLine": "cd ${current.project.path} && grunt server",
        "attributes": {
          "previewUrl": "http://${server.port.8003}"
        }
      }
    ],
 did not appear in the CMD dropbox. Che version: 5.0.0 OS and version: Ubuntu 16.04 Docker version: 1.12.5
