It seems incremental search doesn't work even if it was selected Emacs bindings. Reproduction Steps: Set profile -> preferences and IDE -> Editor -> Key bindings to Emacs Open a C-lang file. Press Ctrl+S 4.. type any keys. Expected behavior: Cursor should be moved matched strings if available. Observed behavior: Just inserted characters into the editor. Che version: Nightly on my cluster. And also today's codenvy.io. OS and version: Probably independent. Docker version: Probably independent. Che install: At least Codenvy. And also my specialized K8s cluster. Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: Unknown Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes
