kind/bug severity/P1 severity/blocker sprint/current-sprint status/open-for-dev team/enterprise severity/P1 status/code-review sprint/current-sprint status/code-review status/open-for-dev 
Steps to reproduce: Create a workspace from the following recipe: FROM codenvy/jdk7
CMD tail -f /dev/null

 Workspace agent does not start since it uses JDK 1.7 that is pre installed in the image. However, this pi—Éce of script https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/wsagent/agent/src/main/resources/org.eclipse.che.ws-agent.script.sh#L52-L57 should have detected that Java version installed in a workspace is not 1.8 and install openjdk package from a debian repo.
