Remove redundant VFS layer
kind/enhancement team/ide sprint/current-sprint status/in-progress 
The benefits that the VFS provided no more actual for current logic and architecture. There is no need for multi tenancy support as long as we're running file system on a single workspace agent instance. We are not using/not implemented most of file system items attributes facilities. As long as any user can intrude a file system via ssh we cannot effectively use file system locks provided by VFS. We cannot rely on index update routines as we're not tracking external file system events but only track VFS events. The removal of virtual file system layer will give us the following benefits: Removing extra layer - simplified logic, less source cod. Reuse of JDK file related libraries - more reliable code Make file/text searcher based on file watchers - make index more stable Remove synchronization required for multi tenancy - performance improvements The general performance and architecture impact is yet to be investigated and analyzed
