Provide ssh vcs editing in dashboard.
kind/enhancement severity/P2 
We currently require ssh vcs keys to be added via workspace Profile > Preferences > SSH > VCS And generate a key. However, it should be in dashboard too. A user emailed me because he thought this needed to be done in dashboard which makes logically sense to me. This isn't a critical enhancement so labeling it P2. Codenvy 5.6.0
