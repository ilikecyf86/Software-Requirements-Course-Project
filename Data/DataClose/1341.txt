Use of exec-maven-plugin:exec:java with System.exit() kills build silently
kind/question 
In many project, for example in /che/assembly/assembly-ide-war/pom.xml, we use the exec:java goal of the maven plugin "exec-maven-plugin". In this particular instance, the maven plugin call org.eclipse.che.util.GwtXmlGenerator. This main class catches exceptions and call System.exit(1). Since the exec:java goal does not start a separate VM to execute the main class, this immediately terminates the maven process. The problem is much worse when using the Eclipse IDE, since in that case, the System.exit() happens inside the process that runs the IDE. Basically, running an incremental build reilably terminates the IDE. I see three options: Don't use the exec-maven plugin, but instead write mojos like DtoGeneratorMojo, for example Don't call System.exit(), but instead throw an exception. I would expect the exec:java goal to catch excptions and handle them properly. Use exec:exec instead of exec:java
