When I open up the git history it locks up the IDE on projects with large history such as che and codenvy repos. After refreshing the page, the history still does not show. Could we load partial history or have a max history limit? Not sure if this is an enhancement, task or bug? Reproduction Steps: Select history in the git menu drop down. Expected behavior: Shows history for repo with large/long history. This should not block the IDE while history is retrieved. Observed behavior: Locks/Blocks IDE and does not show history after refresh of page even after waiting for long period. Che version: Nightly codenvy. Version :5.0.0-M8-SNAPSHOT Revision :c6c0b733b492a7c4 Build Time :2016-11-21 16:40:01 . OS and version: Debian. Docker version: Docker version 1.12.2, build bb80604 Additional information: Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: Not sure. Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: No
