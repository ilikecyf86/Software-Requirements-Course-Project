kind/question 
We found che terminal is very hassle to use , because some command output do not show well. Che use term.js for terminal . But it is no longer maintained, and recommended to use xterm.js https://github.com/chjj/term.js/ So we try to use "xterm.js" front code to instead of "termjs" , and keep backend terminal servcie che current using.The result is very cool , we want to make sure if it is possible to accepted by che. Another bug in che5.0 : Can not support select and copy output in terminal . Reproduction Steps: Open Terminal view 2.Select some output Observed behavior: It auto unselects the output , and can not copy . I think this problem is caused by terminal tab event.
