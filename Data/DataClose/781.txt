Super Dev mode does not work in code generated by archetype generate command
kind/question 
Hi, I follow the development guide to setup the super dev mode, but I got following error after run in Eclipse: Super Dev Mode starting up
   workDir: /var/folders/h1/pv6r45557zqgf4fbbn0nwx_40000gn/T/gwt-codeserver-7497921084797402526.tmp
   Job org.eclipse.che.ide.IDE_1_0
      Loading inherited module 'org.eclipse.che.ide.IDE'
         [ERROR] Unable to find 'org/eclipse/che/ide/IDE.gwt.xml' on your classpath; could be a typo, or maybe you forgot to include a classpath entry for source?
 I do not see org/eclipse/che/ide/IDE.gwt.xml under assembly-ide-war generated by archetype generate command. Does code generated by archetype support debug in super dev mode? Version of Che is 5.10.0
