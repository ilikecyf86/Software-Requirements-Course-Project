page hangs on googleapi when offline
kind/question 
When using eclipse che in offline (with no internet access), loading the web page hangs between 4min and 45min. I've seen the same characteristics on versions 5.11 through 5.17. The page doesn't eventually come up but after a refresh, this process happens again. When running a browser from the same machine as the docker server, the delay is usually about 4min. When running the browser from another machine on the network the delay is typically about 45min. The main files i believe are causing the problem are the four filename below. fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Sans+Mono fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans apis.google.com/js/client:plusone.js?parsetags=explicit connect.facebook.net/en_us/sdk.js Reproduction Steps: Install che on a server that has no internet access. If you simply run che then disable your network, you won't get the same results. This will require loading the che backups eg: eclipse_che-server:5.17.0.tar into docker manually docker load -i eclipse_che-server\:5.17.0.tar. Once che running, navigate to localhost:8080 and see the lag. Opening the debug page will show the delay on the download for the files in question. Note that the apis.google* and the connect.facebook urls will only appear when connecting to a workspace. OS and version: RHEL6 Diagnostics: 'docker run <DOCKER_OPTIONS> eclipse/che info command wont run correctly, system is running offline
