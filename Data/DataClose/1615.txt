Multi-Che Support: Easily run multiple Che instances on the same host. File-Context Git Actions: File context menu for common git actions. PHP Composer: Support for the popular PHP scaffolding utility. Updated PHP Tutorial: Try all the new PHP intellisense and debugging. Memory & Disk Checks on Startup: Resource checks when starting Che. Networking Checks on Startup: Checks browser to workspace and server to workspace connectivity to avoid common network issues. Improved CLI Output: More detail has been added to the info command plus you can generate a diagnostic snapshot for problems. CPU Limiting for Docker Builds: Docker builds can be CPU intensive so they now carry CPU limits to prevent starving other workspaces. Restart a Failed Workspace: You can now easily restart workspaces that didnâ€™t start correctly the first time. Python Intellisense: Syntax highlighting and hover-over help docs.
