One of the main things we are missing coming from using a desktop IDE (Netbeans in my case) is a search feature that shows line numbers and links to the result in the file. Please refer to the screenshot below: The key features are; Column AND line numbers are shown for matches Multiple matches in the same file are shown individually When you click on a search result, the editor loads the file AND jumps straight to the matching line with all instances of the search term already highlighted Most of the work I do relies heavily on the ability to quickly find basic strings across a very large project and at the moment I can't work in Che on the project because of this limitation. Thanks!
