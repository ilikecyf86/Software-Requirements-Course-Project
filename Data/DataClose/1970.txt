Xtext Based Editor Support
kind/question 
I am trying to implement the Editor for my domain-specific language based on Xtext. I am trying to implement editor features like code assist,hightligher and also extension points to the editor. As Che has support for LSP and Xtext beta release has Xtext language server implementation, How I can generate the editor and these feature from given Xtext grammar ? Can Che be extended to support Xtext based editor from the Xtext grammar? Scenario: In my environment from Xtext grammar, we can generate the Xtext DSL editor in Eclipse with editor capabilities like highlighting, code-assist and few editor extensions points. We want to use existing grammar and generate the Che Xtext based Editor. We would be great if you could guide about the compatibility, possible approaches/workaround to achieve this kind of feature with Eclipse Che?
