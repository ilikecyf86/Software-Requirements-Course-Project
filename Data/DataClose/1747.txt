The 'Navigate To File' works incorrectly (regression)
kind/bug team/ide 
When I use the 'Navigate To File', then it does not determine a lower and upper case of input symbols. Reproduction Steps: Open in the IDE a project (e.g. web-java-spring from template). Invoke the 'Navigate To File' from menu or by 'Ctrl+Alt+N'. Enter the 'P'. Expected behavior: should not appear files with lowercase symbol. Observed behavior: the files with lowercase symbol appear in the form. Che version: 5.1.0-SNAPSHOT OS and version: Ubuntu 14.04 Docker version: 1.12 Additional information: Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: [Yes] See the attachment:
