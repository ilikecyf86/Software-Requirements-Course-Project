Multiuser module has infrastructure/openshift submodule where is located only MultiuserInstallerConfigProvisioner which set USER_TOKEN environment variable. But it may make an impression that multiuser has different implementation of OpenShift infrastructure. It is needed to create MachineTokenProvider in che-core-api-workspace module and move injection of USER_TOKEN env variable into che/infrastructure/openshift module. Then single user will have a dummy implementation for MachineTokenProvider and multi user che will have an implementation that provides machine token from MachineTokenRegistry#getOrCreateToken.
