We have API method which updates workspace configuration. One of the fields of this API method is array with environments configurations. But in case of batch update we cannot determine for sure which environments should be updated. For example, we have 2 environments in our workspace. A user makes update request with 2 environments, but exchanges their names. The problem is that we cannot determine whether user just renamed both environments or changed all parameters except names. This information is needed for updating snaphots. And if we cannot correctly update snapshots we should delete them. Also we have other API method which can update specified environment. In this case snapshots should be updated and than workspace will be able to start from snapshot. Use Cases User changes only the name of an environment Name is updated Snapshots are retained User changes the configuration of a workspace or environment (not just the name) Popup is presented to the user: Title: Updated Configuration Invalidates Snapshots Message: Updating the configuration of a workspace or environment will make any associated snapshots impossible to run. Snapshots will be deleted. Buttons: Ok (default); Cancel If "Ok" Configuration is updated Snapshots are deleted If "Cancel" Configuration is reverted Snapshots are retained Is needed for: #2528
