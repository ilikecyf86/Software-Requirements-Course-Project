proxying and port exposure..
kind/question 
I know this has been discussed manytimes before, and probably this is the wrong platform here.. apoligies. I'd like to use che as a 'remote reference dev' platform when on road; but it lacks authorization and tls support. Using a vpn helps, but i don't always carry a laptop.. Auth and tls could be provided by a reverse proxy, but.. Thats not so easily done, because each workspace opens its own port to listen on. I might be blond, but what i was thinking.. We're talking http (and websockets) here, aren't we? So, couldn't we just configure our proxy to translate https://xxx/PORTn/anything into http://host:PORTn/anything and let the proxy do the hard work? So, translate a REST-like url into port assignments? One would have to adapt all url references given from the workspaces into appropriate REST-like urls. Could this be easily done, and, would this even be feasable? As an alternative one could develop a simple tranparent proxy, filtering all ins&outs between webproxy and docker-instances and just replace all url-reference just on text basis... something like sed s#http://\([^:]+\)[:]\([0-9]+\)#http://$1/$2#g any suggestions, or am i totally wrong? [edit: attached a quick diagram about what i was thinking of]
