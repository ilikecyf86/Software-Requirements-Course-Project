cli nightly does not work on different OS or storage drivers
kind/bug severity/blocker 
after we merged this cd5db87 we have problems on mac and centOs error is INFO: Proxy: HTTP_PROXY=, HTTPS_PROXY=, NO_PROXY=*.local, 169.254/16
INFO: (codenvy cli): Checking network... (hint: '--fast' skips version, network, and nightly checks)

 this happen because this path /var/lib/docker/image/aufs/ maybe different for different OS and storage drivers. in production systems we use special data pool devices for docker storage and afaik you can just go there and navigate through files "layers" they all compressed and not accessible. @TylerJewell said that docker inspect -f '{{ .Created }}' codenvy/cli-saas:nightly this does not work for us because this date is not the date when image was written to disk, but why we need to know when it was written? As I understand it should be enough to know when image was built like if image was built today - ok this is accurate one if yesterday - no. We can assume here that nightly image we update each day. So I don't understand why that CREATED date does not work for us, I don;t know why we need to know when it was written to disk because it maybe written today but image can be outdated one, i.e we should know when locally pulled CLI image was built and if it was built more than 24h ago - we do pull it and ask to relaunch CLI @benoitf @TylerJewell wdyt guys?
