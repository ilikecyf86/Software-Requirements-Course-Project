How to expose port from my container?
kind/question 
Description I cant figure out how i should do this. I need to expose port 3333 for my node.js application (i'm testing adonis framework, if it helps). I added server in workspaces -> test_workspace -> servers like this: Next, in commands i have simple command like cd ${current.project.path} && node server.js, and in preview url http://${server.port.3333}. So, problem starts when i try to access generated url. Its unreachable while i can access it via curl localhost:3333. I really feeling that i missed something really simple because sample node js project works great on port 3000 (when i serve my app on 3000 port,its not working). Reproduction Steps Create new workspace with default node.js template. No project importing. Add server that expose 3333 like on image above. Run workspace. Install adonis cli: sudo npm i -g @adonisjs/cli. Run adonis new test_project. Copy .env.example to .env Add command that executes cd ${current.project.path} && node server.js and have preview url http://${server.port.3333} and than run it, click on generated url. Get error in a browser P. S. Sorry my english isnt very good.
