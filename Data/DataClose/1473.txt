File Creation Events
kind/question 
I would like to know more about how events are distributed around Che, and how it goes from workspace to ide and the other way around. For example I would like to have notification in IDE when some file is created. So, when FILE.txt is created, at some path, event is sent to the IDE. And on ide side I have access to path of that file. Which event would that be? And how it should be implemented on both sides, server and client. What I would like is to have something similar to ProjectListeners.java at plugin-java plugin https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/plugins/plugin-java/che-plugin-java-ext-lang-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/plugin/java/server/ProjectListeners.java So when some file is CREATED, the event is sent. I've tried some things, but it hasn't worked for me, so I would like if someone could explain to me a bit more thorough. I also seen similar things answered, but it wasn't exactly the solution, and I couldn't make it work. I would also like to know if it's possible to run commands from server side of the application?
