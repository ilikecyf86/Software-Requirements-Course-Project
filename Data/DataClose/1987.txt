Add pull and save icon to stacks which aren't available offline
kind/enhancement 
With the new electron client and offline behaviors users will see stacks in the user dashboard that may not be available when offline. These stacks will be grayed out. It would be nice to have a button on each stack that would allow someone when they are online to pull and save the stack locally so that they can use it the next time they're offline.
