Samples configuration improvements
kind/enhancement 
Usually if some vendor wants to provide set of samples they put them in single repository like https://github.com/artik-iot/artik-sdk-examples https://github.com/platformio/platformio-examples Our samples configuration provide ability to configure to clone individual modules with keepDir parameter. But usability of this is pretty low. First of all we see all subset of directories of upper level. Second - only root become a project. What is quite unusable. I'm proposing to add one more parameter convertToTopLevelProject that is false by default and activated only if keepDir is not empty and keepVcs is false. If it's configured to true project will be moved to upper level and converted to project. We need to have keepVcs=false because we need to do some adjustments in source tree and after that it's not possible to do any operation with git and I think it's ok, it will be used for demo purposes in most cases.
