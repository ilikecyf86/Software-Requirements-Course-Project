Termination of workspace infrastructure
target/branch status/in-progress status/in-progress status/in-progress status/in-progress 
Workspace service termination is switched off in the spi branch, workspaces are not stopped properly when master servers stops. The goal of the issue is to adapt existing workspace service termination to the new Workspace SPI, so all the running workspaces are gracefully terminated before master server is stopped. In master branch workspace service termination is implemented in core-system module, while it's better to implement terminations independently, directly in components, so the components don't required to expose their internals needed for termination. Consider making ServiceTermination interface public and implement it directly in core-workspace module. depends on #5644
