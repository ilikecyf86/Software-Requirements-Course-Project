Use of smallest possible workspace (/container)
kind/enhancement 
As part of #3748 and Diagnostic agent, idea is to use the smallest possible workspace Using the smallest possible workspace result in having also the smallest possible image alpines images are among the smallest possible images. so basically I would be able to: use an alpine image (without glibc installed) (PR submitted : #4027 ) use software provided by default in alpine without adding extra packages at runtime requiring internet connection. ( PR submitted : #4029 ) allow to use openJDK 1.8 alpine image directly (for now if images has no cmd command it is rejected) ( PR #4702 ) It would be also very nice to avoid the installation of extra agents (like terminal or exec agent if we don't require them. For now, these agents are installed as a dependency of the workspace agent) Reproduction Steps: Create a workspace with openjdk:8-jre-alpine and try to start a workspace.
