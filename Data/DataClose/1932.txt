Create installer for Windows, Mac and Linux (zip)

As part of the .exe, .dmg wizard installers, we should include Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac. When doing an installation of the electron packaging on the system, we should test to see if Docker 1.11 is already present. If it is not, and you are on a valid system where we can install Docker for Windows or Mac, we should offer to instlal it and launch the installers. If not, then we should give users a link to the web site where they can install Docker Toolbox or the right configuration.
