Question: ssh private key location for terminal git cli usage
kind/question 
I imported a git project using the GUI and would like to be able to run git commands in the terminal as well as using the GUI. The problem is that since I imported the git with ssh via GUI, I need the RSA private key to be able to pull and push to the repository While I can generate a new RSA key for each machine and upload to bitbucket. I'd rather use the one I set up in the GUI. and use that over all the workspace machines and other workspaces. Is there a location where this data is mounted on each machine? is there a configuration that I can set to make sure that the config is mounted? Reproduction Steps: Import a private git project in the GUI via ssh method Open terminal make a change to a file and try pushing the change get a permission denied error.
