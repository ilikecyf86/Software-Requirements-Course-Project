Choosing another stack will reset git URL at the top in http://localhost:8080/dashboard/#/create-project wizard

Choosing another stack will reset git URL at the top in http://localhost:8080/dashboard/#/create-project wizard. This is completely unexpected, because what is the point of first asking me for the project URL and then for the stack I want to use (in that vertical order in the dialog) if choosing a stack will reset what I entered before? Reproduction Steps: Go to http://localhost:8080/dashboard/#/create-project Choose "Import from existing locaiton" Choose "Git Repository" (should be already picked by default) and enter a direct HTTPS .git url to some repository which is different than the pre-filled default choice Select "Create new workspace from stack" and then click the C++ stack instead of whatever is the default. (or the Java one if C++ is already pre-selected) Scroll up and see that the git repository URL was changed to some useless example URL OS and version: Your CLI version is 'nightly'.
Your installed version is 'nightly'.
