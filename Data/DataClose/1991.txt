This issue is a subtask from Intelligent command specification in order to handle the commands' goals. This part of the specification: When a user is configuring a commands, he is always doing it for a certain purpose, a certain goal or a certain phase of the project lifecycle. For example, he will define a command to “Build” the projects in the workspaces, he will define a command to “Run” a project, he will define a command to “Deploy” the project and so on. Considering this notion of goal for a command, we will use them in order to better contextualize the commands: Build Test Run Deploy Che will provide default set of goals, but user would have the ability to define/configure them. Command’s goal allow to configure default workspace commands and provide clearer organization and navigation into the commands.
