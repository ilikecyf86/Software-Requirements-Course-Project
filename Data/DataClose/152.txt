Unable to Push the code to Github
kind/question 
Hi, We are trying to make changes to the code in Eclipse-che and push it back ti git hub repository. We followed the below document to setup Github with Eclipse-che: https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/ide/git-svn/index.html#github-oauth Eclipse-Che -version:5.19.0 Docker version: 1.13.1, Host OS:RHEL 7.2 Commnad used to run Eclipse-che: docker run -d --name chemultiusernew -e CHE_DOCKER_IP_EXTERNAL=10.50.68.49 -e CHE_MULTIUSER=true -e CHE_KEYCLOAK_AUTH__SERVER__URL=http://10.50.68.41:8089/auth -e CHE_KEYCLOAK_REALM=Test -e CHE_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT__ID=openshiftio-public -p 9090:9500 -e CHE_PORT=9500 -e CHE_DOCKER_NETWORK=che9500_che-network -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v ~/.che-multiuser:/data eclipse/che start While trying to push code to Github from eclipse-che it is throwing below Error; You are not authorized to perform this operation This may be because you have not setup SSH keys or oAuth. Check the documentation for using Git for more information on setting these up. From the terminal that we can see in Eclipse-che..we were able to commit and push code to the repository.It was working fine. But from the UI ...Using "Remotes" option under Git Dropdown...and selecting push...we were not able to push the code to GitHub.It was throwing above Error. We have Added the user name and Email id under Git Commiter options.But still we are facing the same Issue.
