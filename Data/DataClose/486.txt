Button "Link with editor feature" in the Project Explorer should be marked by blue color if it was activated. Reproduction Steps: Open some project. Open some file from project. Click on the button "Link with editor feature" in the Project Explorer. Expected behavior: if "Link with editor feature" was activated, we should change color of the button to mark activated state. For Project Explorer I guess it's a blue color, the same like for "Maximize panel" button in the Project Explorer. Actual behavior: button color is the same. OS and version: Fedora 25 CHE version: 5.18.0-SNAPSHOT
