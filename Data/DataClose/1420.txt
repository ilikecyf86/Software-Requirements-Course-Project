Not sure if this is a bug or an enhancement request. Steps to reproduce on Win 10. Start Che Start a workspace Stop all running containers. When in the IDE, should a user get a notification saying that connection to a server and ws agent has been lost? Right now, nothing happens. If I stop just ws container, then in the IDE, the workspace is correctly stopped. But if a server container goes down the IDE does not notify a user. @TylerJewell @vparfonov wdyt?
