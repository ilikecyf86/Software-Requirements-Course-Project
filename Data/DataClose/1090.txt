We handle read-only files as editable in some cases. Please see steps to reproduce and video. Reproduction Steps: Open some read-only file (from external library, for example). => you can see in a browser console errors related to attempt to save a content of the file. Try to refresh a page => you can see a browser popup with warning "Change you made may not be saved". Remove the project => the project is removed but the file is still opened.
