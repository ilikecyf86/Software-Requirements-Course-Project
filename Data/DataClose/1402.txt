The documentation at https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/plugins/languageserver/index.html states that CHE implements LSP 2.x, but if you look at the definition textDocument/documentHighlight (https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/versions/protocol-2-x.md#textDocument_documentHighlight), you can see that there is a single document highlight returned, not an array of document highlights. This was correct in the 1.0 version of LSP (https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/versions/protocol-1-x.md), but not 2.x
