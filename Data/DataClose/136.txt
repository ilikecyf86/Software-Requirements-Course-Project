I'm having trouble accessing the codenvy.io site

I'm having trouble accessing the codenvy.io site I would like some maintainer to add the appropriate label for this issue. I'm not allowed to do this Reproduction Steps I was using the site normally. I had to leave and could not get in anymore. I am using the chrome. I was emulating the ubunto when I had to leave and could not get in anymore. I can see the login page but when I log in with my username and password, I get the message Authentication failed. Please check username and password. When I click on the button to reset my password and I put my email I get the message User marisvaldo@gmail.com is not registered in the system. When I try to create a new account to register with the system, I get the message User mail marisvaldo@gmail.com is forbidden. I already tried logging into the site from another computer and another network with a different IP but I had the same problem. I have also tried to access using an anonymous instance and I always have the same problem. If I can not resolve it, I'd like to know if you can delete my account and re-create it.
