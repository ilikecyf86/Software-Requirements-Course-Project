Create event bus to publish events locally and remotely
team/ide kind/enhancement 
We need a handy service for transparently publishing events locally and remotely (over the network). The main idea is to make it as simple as EventService but with ability to register subscribers and to publish events on remote endpoints as well as keep local functionality. I see JSON-RPC as the most suitable transport platform here for remote communication and EventService or something similar for local. We also need to work out solid platform independent API for the remote operations to make it possible for custom clients to be able to interact with the service.
