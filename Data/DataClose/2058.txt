Chefile needs to support docker-compose file

I'm attempting to chefile https://github.com/10up/twentysixteenreact which has both a dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml. Currently chefile/chedir uses the dockerfile only. The correct mechanism would be to use the docker-compose.yml. Also the Chefile documentation at https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/chefile indicates that a composefile can be added inline into the configuration using the workspace.runtime.docker.composefile key. This does not currently do anything.
