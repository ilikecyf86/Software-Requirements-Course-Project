Small question: what is inside eclipse/che:latest - where to find the dockerfile?
kind/question 
It is not an issue but just a question: I cannot find the dockerfile of eclipse/che:latest that launches codenvy/che-server. (described in this page https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/usage-docker). Where can it be found? And furthermore, can I ask you: what is the interest of this supplementary image? I mean, what is the improvement compared to: docker run --net=host --name che -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /home/user/che/lib:/home/user/che/lib-copy -v /home/user/che/workspaces:/home/user/che/workspaces -v /home/user/che/storage:/home/user/che/storage codenvy/che-server (but maybe if I see it, I will understand.)
