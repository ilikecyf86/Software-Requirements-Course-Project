Can't create a workspace or anything for that matter with latest eclipse che
kind/question 
Not working with 64 bit ubuntu server 16:04 i have tested this twice both with fresh installs. i followed the steps both on docker site and eclipse local install instructions. I'm accessing the local server by going to the LAN ip address (no gui so cant use localhost) from my laptop and everything looks ok except for the fact that i cannot create a container (workspace) from the web gui, the buttons just don't run. Docker is installed and hello world image runs... Reproduction Steps: install ubuntu server 16.04 follow all insctuctions for docker + eclipse che local install cry Expected behavior: create/delete workspaces Observed behavior: "create" buttons do nothing. Che version: 5.0.0-latest OS and version: Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit (server) Docker version: native 1.12.3 Che install: Docker container Additional information: Got eclipse che to install and work on my raspberry pi 2 just wanted more power with proper server. Looks to be exactly what i need (great software) just can't get it working now. Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: [Yes/No] Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: [Yes/No]
