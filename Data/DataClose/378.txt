Remove rewrite /wsmaster/api/* to /api/*

A long time ago requests to ws-master were like http://localhost:8080/api/user. After we decided to change the name of api war to wsmaster. To make this change compatible with the previous version we have a rewrite rule. RewriteRule ^/api/(.*)$ /wsmaster/api/$1 [L] After that, part of our application are making request to /api some to /wsmaster/api Internally this solution works more or less. But eventually, it produces small chaos and unpredictable problems. Like I have redirection loop with Keycloak Opeid Filter because I have a request to /api but it was internally transformed to /wsmaster/api and result cookies was set on the path /wsmaster/api but it wasn't expected. I think it's time to drop this workaround with RewriteRule in next version of Che.
