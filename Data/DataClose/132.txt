Description Sometimes appearing and disappearing of pull request panel is not comfortable: After IDE loading, clicking on a project causes appearance of the panel. In most cases it is useless and uses editor's space. If two (or more) projects are added into workspace and some of them aren't under git, changing selection in project explorer between them or even tabs in editor causes the panel appearance and disappearance. And a user has no ability to alter or turn off such annoying behaviour. If someone have to work with two projects, where one of them isn't project under git - it's a disaster. Reproduction Steps Open a workspace Select a project under git in project explorer Screencast: Once it closed don't show it again until page is refreshed If panel is opened and the current project isn't a git project then some massage should be dipslayed
