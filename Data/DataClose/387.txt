Errors on building Che CLI docker images
kind/bug team/production target/branch severity/P1 status/in-progress sprint/current-sprint status/in-progress 
I needed to rebuild Che CLI images in the repo and got several issues with it. When I build images using the script that builds all the images it fails with a message: che/build.sh: line 37: cd: che: No such file or directory When the previous problem is workarounded I got another error: Script run successfully: eclipse/che-cli:nightly
