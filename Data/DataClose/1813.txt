Machine API related house keeping
kind/epic 
It is umbrella epic to cover cleaning all the machine API related things. The problem is that as a result of evolution of our vision many abstractions, classes, UI components and even API(s) now looks odd. It is a quite big pile of code which we do not effectively use but have to support, test and package. But the even bigger problem is that such a code makes a big deal of confusing for community developers who is not familiar with the history.
