Proxy settings exported in the workspace container for a user not root

When http and https proxies are applied, they are applied for a current user in a container. However, apt-get or dnf or yum or any package manager commands should be run with sudo. A root user does not have those envs, as a result any package manager commands that need connection fail. This affects launching agents in Che and Codenvy.
