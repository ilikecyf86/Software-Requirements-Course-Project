Change workspace idle timeout
kind/enhancement severity/P2 
The workspace timeout in the che.env file and default hard coded idle timeout should be changed to 4 hours. che.env # Idle Timeout
#     The length of time that a user is idle with their workspace when the system will suspend the
#     workspace by snapshotting it and then stopping it. Idleness is determined by the length of
#     time that the user has not interacted with the workspace, meaning that one of our agents
#     has not received instructions. Leaving a browser window open counts as idleness time.
