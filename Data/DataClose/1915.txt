kind/question kind/bug team/ide kind/question severity/P2 
Hi all, I install eclipse/che and working good, but I have problem with self hosted gitlab. I go to profile/preference/ssh/vcs and generate keys: git@my.host.pl git@my.host.pl:3333/ my.host.pl:3333/ http://my.host.pl/ http://my.host.pl:3333 Next I trying import project from git. I paste: git@my.host.pl:3333/my/repo.git click import and I getting error: "java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable get private ssh key. You can create a new SSH key pair in Profile->Preferences->SSH->Git" Expected behavior: Import repo from self hosted gitlab Observed behavior: Prompt with error Che version: Version :5.0.0-M7 OS and version: debian 7 Docker version: 1.7 Che install: docker container Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: I don't test it in older versions Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: I think yes
