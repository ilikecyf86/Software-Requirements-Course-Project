How to use CHE_EXTRA_VOLUME_MOUNT?
kind/question 
Use Case The code that I wish to edit in che is downloaded from a private SVN repository and uses a private nexus repository for maven dependencies. Due to this I need to use my custom settings.xml from "C:\Users\<user_name>\.m2". It would be good to use the local maven repository too, hence the approach of creating a custom dockerfile that adds settings.xml was not used. Problem Can't see the mount path "/home/user/.m2" in any workspace. Setup I created a user environment variable "CHE_EXTRA_VOLUME_MOUNT" with the value "~/.m2:/home/user/.m2". I can see the env variable from "Docker Quickstart Terminal". Environment OS: Windows 7 Docker version: 1.12.6, build 78d1802 Docker image: eclipse/che-server:5.0.0 http://stackoverflow.com/q/41787943/1660558
