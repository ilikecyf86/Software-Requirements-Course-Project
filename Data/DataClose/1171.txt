This issue is covering few improvements to the command toolbar. Command controller When there are no command defined, clicking on the command controller widget, must unfold and propose "Create new command". It will open the command explorer and create a new command in goal "Run". Previews When there are no previews, we show a small down arrow. While the arrow imply that there is something to see. Our behavior is incorrect because, user can click on it but nothing happen, so it looks buggy. We should show a message "No commands running Tooltip must work on the whole shape of the button not only on the icon Run/Debug buttons We should improve the behavior so that it's possible to display all the commands without doing a long-click. left area: Single click - execute the default run command. Long click - as today, it shows the list of all commands with corresponding goal and allow to select and default a command right area: When clicked, it shows the list of all commands with corresponding goal and allow to select and default a command We'll need to manage the hover and selected state separately for the two areas of the button. When no command with goal debug exist, propose choice "Create debug command" instead of "Create and start command" When no command with goal run exist, propose choice "Create run command" instead of "Create and start command"
