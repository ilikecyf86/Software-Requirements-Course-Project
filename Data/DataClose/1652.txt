No che-server logs in logs folder

New Che CLI creates logs folder in instance folder but doesn't write there logs of che-server. Also there is folder /data/logs where logs of machines are stored. For example Codenvy CLI stores logs of both in /logs/codenvy. Che version: 5.2.0-SNAPSHOT OS and version: Ubuntu 16.04 Docker version: 1.12.5
