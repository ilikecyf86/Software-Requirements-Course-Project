How do I configure multiple eclipse che instances on one aws EC2 instance for multiple users (<10) with nginx?
kind/question 
I've read through many issues related to this, e.g. issue 877 and many of the nginx issues, but I'm still a little confused. So what I want is an interface where each user has their own secure eclipse che instance with their own workspaces on the same EC2 instance. From what I've seen, nginx is the best way to do this because you can have multiple urls map to the same ip (my EC2 instance) through different ports. And I think I'm correct that through nginx I can choose which ips have access to which ports? So if I have user "tequa" with his own eclipse che instance, the idea is that only his machine will have access to *.amazon.com/tequa (which maps to port xxxx), I'm assuming? I installed nginx on the ec2 instance and edited the nginx.conf file so that my two different che folders (with the instances and workspaces) were reverse proxied to two different local host ports. But I feel like this is not at all what I should be doing since these folders just have data and not the actual docker images for eclipse che? So how do I set this reverse proxy for the eclipse che docker containers? I saw your article where you did this with workspaces, but I'm not sure how to do this with the whole eclipse che container.
