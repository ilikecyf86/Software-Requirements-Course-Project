CLI - Custom Assembly, Version Bug, Latest Checks
kind/bug kind/enhancement 
This issue is a collection of various improvements. The version command was broken with changes to the DockerHub API. The API now uses pagination to display lists of tags. So we will only display the first 10 tags and then print out the next pagination link to display the older versions. Only perform this check if we are not in offline mode. Move offline mode to be a check that happens during bootstrap, not later when we are testing networking mode. Updates some of the code to use is_offline() and is_fast() utility functions. Add in concept of :/assembly mount which will directly mount an assembly and bypass the :/repo mode, which uses the repo for the assembly AND other stuff like puppet manifests. If you are not in offline mode, now performs a check of the current image's version against the first 10 versions returned from DockerHub. If a newer version is available on DockerHub, the version is printed out as a warning.
