How to debug the workspace agent in Eclispe
kind/question 
Hi, I am trying to debug the code in extension for workspace agent. I use the JSON editor template generated by archetype. I see following instruction from guide Dashboard -> Workspaces -> Runtime tab -> Servers
# Find the server with the `wsagent.debug` reference
wsagent.debug 4403 http	http://172.17.0.1:40037
 https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Development-Workflow#debugging-workspace-agent I can see these information from Che page, then what should I do in Eclipse to debug following code? I tried remote java application on the ports, but the connection can not be established.
