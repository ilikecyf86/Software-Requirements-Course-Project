Fail to build an image from a Dockerfile
kind/question 
che.zip Only the first buffer full gets processed, as shown in the Log. Removing the first "RUN echo" line causes more of the JAVA_HOME line to be included. Reproduction Steps: Place the attached Dockerfile on a remote http server. Reference the Dockerfile in a new Workspace (As the Recipe URL under Stack import) with type "Dockerfile". Build the workspace I've also tried this with 5.12 and 5.13 (with separate /data mounts) and got the same result. The Dockerfile downloads correctly in Chrome and with curl. I discovered this when I couldn't rebuild my existing workspace after the running version appeared to have become corrupted. That workspace is actually based on a compose recipe that then references two Dockerfiles. The first is very short and works, the second is the attached, which fails.
