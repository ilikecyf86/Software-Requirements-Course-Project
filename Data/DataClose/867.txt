PostgreSQL db-machine
kind/question 
Everytime I restart my workspace the db-machine recreates the database and all the content from previous runs is lost. Reproduction Steps: Created and started a custom workspace based on postgresql (db-machine) and ubuntu_jdk8 (dev-machine) images. I created my images, built them and added them to my local registry. For the db image I'm using the docker-entrypoint-initdb.d and add a sql script that creates the DB and all it's objects. I'm referring to the image in my compose as: services: db: image: 'localhost:5000/fe_db' I created some data in a table of the DB and restarted workspace. The debug starting process shows every object in the DB is recreated and when I check for the data, it's lost. OS and version: Dockerized version of che 5.2 running in my local machine (Ubuntu 16.04) and docker version reports: 17.05.0-ce
