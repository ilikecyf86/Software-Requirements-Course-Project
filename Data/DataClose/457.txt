OpenShift infrastructure: add TLS support of routes
target/branch 
Currently OpenShift infrastructure does not support TLS which is one of the things that prevents 'spi' to be working on osio. In order to enable TLS the following steps need to be done: Having property che.infra.openshift.secure.routes for enabling TLS during route creation Implement URLRewriter which would pick suitable protocol depending on che.infra.openshift.secure.routes property On OSIO custom router is used which completely ignores the 'host' field and assumes that routes host is supposed to have the following format $NAME.$NAMESPACE where: $NAME = route name $NAMESPACE = namespace where route has been created. In theory this supposed to work OOTB, since while route creation the 'host' is not used while route creation, but it still fails for me on osio (looks like there is extra 'che-' path in the route which results in 503 error during workspace creation)
