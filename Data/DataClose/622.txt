Cursor position jumping back to top of file.
kind/question 
Cursor position skips back to the top when moving away and back to a tab. This happens after certain files are introduced to the workspace. For example, it doesn't happen on a workspace and then after creating a testfile with the contents of the link below it will proceed to happen on that workspace from thereafter. Makes working on large files very frustrating. Reproduction Steps: Copy the following file into a workspace: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magento/magento2/develop/app/code/Magento/Catalog/Controller/Category/View.php Scroll cursor position down in any file within the workspace Move away from that tab. Move back to that tab (the tab will be positioned back at the top). OS and version: Ubuntu 14.04, Chrome 60, Eclipse Che 5.15
