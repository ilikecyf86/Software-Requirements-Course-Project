Incorrect buld & run instructions on http://eclipse.org/che

Currenly mainpage of the progect says: # <...>
git clone https://github.com/codenvy/che 
git checkout 4.0 
cd assembly-sdk
mvn clean install

cd ..
./che run
http://localhost:8080 These script doesnt work for 4.0 at least (minor) add "cd ./che" after clonning there is no che.bat/che.sh neither in root nor assembly-sdk Please, update the mainpage
