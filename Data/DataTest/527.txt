Eclipse Che Space in filepath error
duplicate 
I wrote the question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35143201/eclipse-che-not-starting-up/35143646#35143646, and followed the answer. It worked, but it said to post the issue here. I'm using Windows 10, 64 bit. I downloaded the nightly version on 2/1/2016. This is the directory: C:\Program Files\Eclipse Che\eclipse-che-nightly\eclipse-che-4.0.0-RC1-snapshot/ Just to clarify, the answer posted worked.
