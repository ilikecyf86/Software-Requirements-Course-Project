CHE-605 Default workspace behaviours
dev 
This is an autogenerated issue. Original: https://jira.codenvycorp.com/browse/CHE-605 Reporter: St√©van Le Meur Description: Following the discussion we had during the R&D call of Tuesday 23th February, we need to change the default behaviours of workspace states. When, a new workspace is created: it always start from a base image. When a user is working in a workspace, we need to: auto-snapshot the state of the workspace where we are shutting it down auto-restore the latest workspace's snapshot when the user come back to his work. This way, the default behaviour will be that the user will get his workspace in the exactly same state as it was when he leaves it.
