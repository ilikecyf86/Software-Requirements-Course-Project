CHE-622 Commands are added to custom stacks

This is an autogenerated issue. Original: https://jira.codenvycorp.com/browse/CHE-622 Reporter: Daria Dementieva Description: Steps to reproduce: In UD create a new project from custom stack and existing location. Open it in the IDE. As a result, default Java stack commands are added to a workspace. It looks like when we select custom stack, UD still respects the stack selected by default, which is Java. A different way to reproduce it is to select a NodeJS stack, then custom stack. As a result, Node commands are saved into workspace config.
