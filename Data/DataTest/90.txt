Question - Remote HTTP Git with user/pass options
kind/question 
Hi to all I'm trying to implement a Che environment for some users with shared workspaces connected to different Git projects. I know about the current limitation about user authentication on Che, but this not affect my environment for a while. If we clone a GitLab repo with http URL, the git console asks to put a user and password for each communication with the main repo. Is it possible enable this feature for the Che Git Menu? I have 10 users on my dev team, and today they use standard Eclipse with +- 25 workspaces each, and GitLab with +- 40 projects. The implementation of SSH keys for each user at each workspace is to hard to maintain, and the user need to enter at current workspace and set your gitCommit data at menu profile. I think this will be useful to register a correct user for commits history on shared workspaces... Thanks for all! Eclipse Che is awesome!
