Che will not start when JAVA_HOME does not match "java -version" on Windows
kind/question kind/bug 
I put my machine to sleep, then came back. I know this can cause trouble but I won't be rebooting my machine every time I run Che. Here is what happened when I started the che server (NOTE: I am running Java 8 despite the warnings, see the full transcript): C:\Users\snorthov\eclipse-che-4.0.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT\bin>che run On Windows, Che projects can only reside in %userprofile% due to limitations of Docker. On this computer, %userprofile% is C:\Users\snorthov Docker machine named default already exists... Setting environment variables for machine default... Docker is configured to use vbox docker-machine named default with IP 192.168.99 .100... ######## HOW TO CONNECT YOUR CHE CLIENT After Che server has booted, you can connect your clients by: Open browser to http://localhost:8080, or: Open native chromium app. Che requires Java version 1.8 or higher. We found a lower version. Looks like something went wrong. Possible issues: (Win | Mac) VirtualBox not installed ==> Rerun Docker Toolbox inst allation (Win | Mac) Docker Machine not installed ==> Rerun Docker Toolbox inst allation (Win | Mac) Docker is not reachable ==> Docker VM failed to start (Win | Mac) Docker ok, but docker ps fails ==> Docker environment variab les not set properly (Linux) Docker is not reachable ==> Install: wget -qO- https: //get.docker.com/ | sh (Linux) Permissions not properly set ==> Che must run as UID 1000 with user in docker group Could not find the Che app server ==> Did /tomcat get moved awa y from CHE_HOME? Wrong version of Java found ==> Che requires Java 1.8 Did you use the right parameter syntax? ==> See usage We have seen issues with VirtualBox on Windows where your VM gets corrupted when your computer is suspended while the VM is still running. This will appear as SSH or ethernet con nection issues. This is rare, but if encountered, current known solution is to uninstall VirtualBox and Docker Toolbox, and then reinstall. Che Environment Variables: (REQUIRED) JAVA_HOME ==> Location of Java runtime (REQUIRED: WIN|MAC) DOCKER_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_PATH ==> Location of Docker Toolbo x (REQUIRED: WIN|MAC) VBOX_MSI_INSTALL_PATH ==> Location of VirtualBox (OPTIONAL) CHE_HOME ==> Directory where Che is in stalled (OPTIONAL) CHE_LOCAL_CONF_DIR ==> Directory with custom Che .properties files (OPTIONAL) CHE_LOGS_DIR ==> Directory for Che output logs (OPTIONAL) CHE_DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME ==> (Win | Mac) Name of VM cr eated by docker-machine (OPTIONAL) DOCKER_MACHINE_HOST ==> (Linux) Docker host IP - set if browser clients remote Usage: che [OPTIONS] [run | start | stop] -i, --image Launches Che within a Docker container using late st image -i:tag, --image:tag Launches Che within a Docker container using spec ific image tag -p:port, --port:port Port that Che server will use for HTTP requests; default=8080 -r:ip, --remote:ip If Che clients are not localhost, set to IP addre ss of Che server -g, --registry Launch Docker registry as a container (used for w s snapshots) -m:vm, --machine:vm For Win & Mac, sets the docker-machine VM name to vm; default=default -s:client, --skip:client Do not print browser client connection informatio n -s:uid, --skip:uid Do not enforce UID=1000 for Docker -h, --help Show this help -d, --debug Use debug mode (prints command line options + app server debug) run Starts Che application server in current console start Starts Che application server in new console stop Stops Che application server The -r flag sets the DOCKER_MACHINE_HOST system environment variable. Set this t o the IP address of the node that is running your Docker daemon. Only necessary to set this if on Linux and y our browser clients are not localhost, ie they are remote. This property automatically set for Che on Window s and Mac.
