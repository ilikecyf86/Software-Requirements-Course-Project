What's the difference between the two concepts "recipe" and "stack"

I found there are two concepts are quite similar in CHE, one is "recipe" and another one is "stack". In my opinion, a "recipe" just a Dockerfile which defines some ports and softwares and can be used to build a workspace machine, what's the difference between "stack" and it?
