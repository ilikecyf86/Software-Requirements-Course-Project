Can I change che server port through -p:port?

I tried to change my che server port to 80 through che -p:80 run, however, the che server did actually bind to port 80 but the redirect server port still 8080, such as: 2016-05-13 20:14:02,636[kspaceManager-0] [ERROR] [o.e.c.a.w.s.WorkspaceManager 538] - Can't start machine ws-machine because machine recipe downloading failed.
