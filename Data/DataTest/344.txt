CHE-676 Dialogs lose focus when we use tab button

This is an autogenerated issue. Original: https://jira.codenvycorp.com/browse/CHE-676 Reporter: Roman Nikitenko Description: For example we have input dialog: text box and two buttons("OK" and "Cancel"). Focus on the text box. Press tab button: Focus will be on "OK" button. Press tab button: Focus will be on "Cancel" button Press tab button: dialog will lose focus. I think at this moment focus should be on the text box and dialog shouldn't lose focus when we press tab several times.
