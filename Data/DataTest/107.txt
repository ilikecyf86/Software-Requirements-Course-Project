Groovy editor: How to do it. github che-tutorials/che-tutorial-editor-api or che website?
kind/question kind/docs 
Hello, I would like to add a groovy text editor extension to eclipse che. However, I'm quite confused in what basis I should take. Is https://github.com/codenvy/che-tutorials/tree/master/che-tutorial-editor-api the right entry point? Is it up to date? Because it differs from https://eclipse-che.readme.io/v1.0/docs/editor instructions. If I use he last link, I don't understand what means adding groovy.js to the client bundle with @source("groovy.js") TextResource groovyParserJS(); . In what class? And what project this sentence refers to :"In this example it is located at src/main/resources/org/eclipse/che/ide/tutorial/editor/groovy.js."? I tried to add the che-tutorial-editor-api to che by: adding the extension as a dependency to assembly-ide-war/pom.xml adding it as a GWT inheritance to the Che IDE GWT definition at /che/assembly-ide-war/src/main/resources/org/eclipse/che/ide/IDE.gwt.xml building che assembly Then I launch che but nothing has changed. I presume being totally missing the point.
