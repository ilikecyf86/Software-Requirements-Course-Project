How to add python stacks to the predefined-stack.json

Hi, Am new to Che and having difficulty trying to find my way here. I want to use the python images in codenvy dockerhub and add that to predefined_stack.json file. So that python stack is available via dashboard page in Che. When I do that however, it doesn't work with status looking like this: [DOCKER] Step1: FROM codenvy/python27 [DOCKER] ---> 35176b922f1c [DOCKER] ---> Successfully built 35176b922f1c Machine is destroyed. Am not able to get hang of it. Please help. By the way I could create Python workspace by using Docker file and selecting Create New Workspace from Custom Stack->Write your own stack.
