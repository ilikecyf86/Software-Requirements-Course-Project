How to use the provided tomcat8 in workspace image "codenvy/ubuntu_jdk8"?

I see in the provided "codenvy/ubuntu_jdk8", it has provided a tomcat8, and also exposes the port 8080. But I'm not sure how to use it, do I have to start it manually? Or do I have to modify pom.xml and use it from some maven plugins? Is there any example for a web application?
