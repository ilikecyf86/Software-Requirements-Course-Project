Che wont start because of Java but i have the right version.
kind/question 
I have installed Che =by installing the prerequisites noted here: https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/install-pre-reqs then followed the readme instructions on github. everything seems to work until i try to start the server where i receive the error: Che requires Java version 1.8 or higher. We found a lower version. the only problem is the java version im running is: Java version "1.8.0_72" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_72-b15) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.72-b15, mixed mode) This should be enough to satisfy the Java 1.8 Requirement should it not?
