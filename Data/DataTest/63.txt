Artik IDE not reuseable
kind/bug 
Hello, I am running the artik ide using the vagrant. Everything works fine. But if the system is booted without saving VM state using the vagrant suspend then, when I try to do vagrant up next time it gets stuck at ARTIK IDE: BOOTING ECLIPSE CHE and the IDE never starts. What has to be done in such case?
