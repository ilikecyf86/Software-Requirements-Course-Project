CHE-536 Differentiate explicitly created and detected projects on Workspace Agent. Do not save detected to Master ProjectConfig.

This is an autogenerated issue. Original: https://jira.codenvycorp.com/browse/CHE-536 Reporter: Gennady Azarenkov Description: From the behaviour standpoint there are two types of projects: 1/ Ones created explicitly - by user's add, import/update etc Project calls 2/ Detected projects - like Maven modules calculated using parent's pom.xml and files structure. Projects of 1-st type should be synchronized with Projects Config stored on Workspace Master side, projects of 2-nd type are initialized every time when "parent" project initialized .
