Can't start machine dev-machine. Connection timed out

I am trying to run che on an Amazon EC2 instance running Ubuntu 14.04 (also tried Amazon AMI) and have trouble creating workspaces. I get the following error: 2016-01-08 18:55:52,613[kspaceManager-0] [ERROR] [o.e.c.a.w.s.WorkspaceManager 615] - Can't start machine dev-machine. Connection timed out org.eclipse.che.api.machine.server.exception.MachineException: Can't start machine dev-machine. Connection timed out at org.eclipse.che.api.machine.server.MachineManager.getRecipeByLocation(MachineManager.java:981) ~[che-core-api-machine-4.0.0-beta-5.jar:4.0.0-beta-5] at org.eclipse.che.api.machine.server.MachineManager.createMachine(MachineManager.java:292) ~[che-core-api-machine-4.0.0-beta-5.jar:4.0.0-beta-5] ... Everything I'm doing so far seems pretty boilerplate. The one exception of course is that my client browser is remote. Same thing happens if I launch it in a docker container vs. locally. Any idea what I'm doing wrong?
