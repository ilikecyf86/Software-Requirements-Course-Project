creating containers from local dockerfiles
kind/question kind/enhancement 
Hi, How can i create docker containers from docker files sitting in my local machine. I was able to create my custom stack and updated the "stacks/predefined-stacks.json" with an entry for my custom stack and gave docker file source as a dockerfile from docker hub: "source": { "type": "image", "origin": "nisc/customerDockerFIle" }, i want to create my container from docker file sitting in my local host, and i was not able to find much about what values these attributes take. What should be the values for "type" and "origin" to pick docker file from my local system. also if i want to create templates from my local machine rather than git. Are these parameters documented somewhere? Thanks, Nischal Y
