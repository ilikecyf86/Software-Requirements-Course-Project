This is an autogenerated issue. Original: https://jira.codenvycorp.com/browse/CHE-581 Reporter: Aleksandr Shmaraev Description: * Open the dashboard and go to 'Workspaces' -> 'New Workspace'. Select the 'Import an existing workspace configuration' and insert a json file (e.g.https://gist.githubusercontent.com/idexmai/68382088ebe82f9b901d/raw/9fecf4257c5f8f530550c3b4135edafdb889993c/phpWs.json). Create workspace, open in IDE, switch to the 'Machine Perspective' and select the 'Recipe'. Expected: should be displayed 'From codenvy/php'. Actual: the 'From codenvy/ubuntu_jdk8' is displayed.
