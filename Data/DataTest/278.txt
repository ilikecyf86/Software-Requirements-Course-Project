Gradle support
New feature status/open-for-dev Improvement kind/enhancement status/open-for-dev Improvement 
Hi! Do you have any plans to implement a gradle support? I found a description how to create a project on your site (https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/che-and-gradle), but code completion and dependency refreshing seem not to work in this project. Are there any plans to implement it?
