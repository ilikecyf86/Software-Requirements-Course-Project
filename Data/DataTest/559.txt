127.0.0.1:8080 always redirects to /che/default for Chrome
can't reproduce 
I uninstalled Che, checked every autocomplete setting there is, and my browser is still redirecting me to /che/default/ whenever I visit 127.0.0.1 through Chrome. Doesn't do the same on Firefox. This is probably more of a Chrome bug but I thought I would report it here for any luck.
