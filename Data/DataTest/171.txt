Error of loading java class from another module in time of debugging
kind/bug 
Use case Open multi-module project in Eclipse Che, for example [https://github.com/codenvy/cdec|CDEC project]. Set breakpoint into java class which uses class from another module, for example, in class [ConfigCommand.java https://github.com/codenvy/cdec/blob/master/installation-manager-cli-bundle/src/main/java/com/codenvy/im/cli/command/ConfigCommand.java#L58] of module installation-manager-cli-bundle. Run project in debug mode. Connect to remote debug session of project from Che. Step into method of class of another module, for example, AbstractArtifact.createArtifact() of module installation-manager-core. Actual wrong result IDE opens tab with title ArtifactFactory and error message instead of content: {noformat} An error occurred while loading the file. {noformat} There was error response on http request http://localhost:8080/ide/ext/jdt/workspaceylhzlmw1177yfy71/navigation/contentbyfqn?projectpath=/cdec/installation-manager-cli-bundle&fqn=com.codenvy.im.artifacts.ArtifactFactory: {noformat} Can't find type: com.codenvy.im.artifacts.ArtifactFactory {noformat} !error-of-step-into-java-class-from-another-module_2016-01-19.png|thumbnail!
