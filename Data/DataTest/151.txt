Make internal API accessible

The che code is often relatively protected and hard to extend/reuse. For instance EditorInputImpl can not be reused but needs to be copied. I understand that you don't want to expose too much public API too early, but I think it would be nicer to communicate it more informally. E.g. you could introduce (or reuse) an annotation similar to @beta from guava to indicate that some concepts are not public and might change. This leaves the decision to ignore it and live with breaking changes to the user. Also you won't be forced to copy/paste your own code (e.g. org.eclipse.che.ide.extension.machine.client.perspective.widgets.recipe.editor.RecipeEditorInput). In Eclipse there are even more fine grained information, about how some API might be used how not (see https://wiki.eclipse.org/API_Javadoc_tags).
