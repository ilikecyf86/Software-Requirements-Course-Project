Is there a factory file?

I find the way to expose a badge or Che factory to be under-exposed (e.g. Codenvy could show Markdown code to include to put a badge). My question is, is there a .eclipse-che.json or similar file which people could write and include under source control? The current model, that file is on Codenvy or Che hosted. This means it doesn't evolve with the code, and one cannot just copy it and use it on its own running Che. My suggestion (if not already possible) is to move that file under source control and have the starting from factory be like: https://my-eclipse-che.com/f?git=<path-to-git-repo> and when Che downloads that repo (using credentials if necessary), I'd look and create a runtime for the .eclise-che.json. Kind of like .editorconfig or pom.yml.
