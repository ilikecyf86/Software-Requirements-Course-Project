Build fails with symbolic links under windows
kind/bug 
We tried to build one of our web applications with Eclipse Che. The build fails because one of the maven plug-ins we use (https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) needs to create symlinks in the directory of our project. If we trigger the build on a Windows 10 host, it fails. Steps to reproduce (in Windows): Create a new workspace and import project from https://github.com/akoch/che-symlink-problem.git Create a new maven command with 'Command line' -> 'compile' Execute the command The resulting error message is: "Could not extract the Node archive: Could not extract archive: '/projects/che-symlink-problem/node/node_tmp/node.tar.gz': No such file or directory This message is misleading. The failing reason is an error when a symlink is created while the node.js-archive is unpacked."
