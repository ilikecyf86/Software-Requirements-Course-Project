how can I get the same workspace which I was working on when I restart Che server.
status/code-review 
this is not an issue. this is a question. I am trying to understand the working of che. This may look like a dumb question. I am using system with windows OS. I have installed the che server in this local system with the help of the installer. So the che server , browser and VM(which contains the docker container) are in the same machine. Now when I start the che server and run this URL "http://localhost:8080/dashboard/" in the browser, I am able to see the dashboard. And also I am able to create the workspace and projects. But when I restart the che server and run this URL "http://localhost:8080/dashboard/" again, at this time how can I get/access the workspace and projects which I have created earlier.?? The documents which you have provided are very good. But I feel I am somehow failing to understand this. Thanks for the help.
