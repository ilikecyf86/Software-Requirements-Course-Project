Can't find REST API about auth.
kind/docs 
hi, I find the auth REST API in https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/rest-api. However, when I visit http://localhost:8080/swagger/, I can't find auth item. The version of Che is 4.3.4. In addition, I donâ€˜t understand the content of https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/authentication,can you give me some advice or more docs about authentication management? How to achieve user management? For example, showing specific workspaces based on which account was logined, like visiting http://beta.codenvy.com/. I find REST API in http://beta.codenvy.com/swagger are much more than http://localhost:8080/swagger/.Where can I read relevant sources about these services?
