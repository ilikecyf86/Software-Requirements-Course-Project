Simplify workspace API by using single Workspace model
kind/bug 
Now workspace structure is to complicated and brings a batch of problems. Current workspace model consists of 3 main objects WorkspaceConfig, UsersWorkspace, RuntimeWorkspace. The relation between those objects is not monosemantic as UsersWorkspace is in composition with WorkspaceConfig when RuntimeWorkspace interits UsersWorkspace. The solution is to have 1 single workspace model object which has 3 main fields in composition: Workspace { config, instance, runtime } This model allows as to keep all workspace data synchronized and actual.
