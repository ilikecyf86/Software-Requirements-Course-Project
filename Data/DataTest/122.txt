Quick Tips for Creating a Wizard
status/open-for-dev 
I have looked over the Java Wizard and a couple of older wizards from the Codenvy github repository but I have not been able to find a concise description of how to create and then add a wizard to Che. There is a brief page on writing wizards in the V1.0 documentation but I cannot find references to wizards in the latest docs. Is it there and I am simply missing it? I would like to create a new project type and have the wizard popped on creation to walk the user through filling out an initial project skeleton. I can follow the example of the Java Wizard, but would like to limit my flailing if possible. If there a document that describes how to bind a wizard into a new project definition, that would be very helpful. Barring that, could someone provide a bit advice or a quick outline of steps to follow? Thanks, Stephan
