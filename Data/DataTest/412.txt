Cannot crate workspace
kind/question 
_1 Upvote_ I have Eclipse Che downloaded from here: https://install.codenvycorp.com/che/eclipse-che-latest.zip (Version 4.0.0 - RC3). I installed docker from here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/centos/ Java JRE Installed: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_72-b15) I start the che.sh with "./che.sh --skip:uid --port:15143". I wait for it to load. I enter the dashboard and make a new workspace. I get this error after some time: Thanks for helping! :D
