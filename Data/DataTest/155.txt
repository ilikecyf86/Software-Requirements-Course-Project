Hi, System description: Host OS: Windows Virtual box:Oracle VM virtual box 5.0.12 guest OS: Ubuntu 14.04 trusty. kernel version: 4.2.0-27-generic Scenario: I have a host system running a windows OS. I have installed the Oracle VM Vitrual box. In this VM box I installed a ubuntu OS as VM. Installed Java 8. After doing this I did setup the docker inside this ubuntu as per this link "https://docs.docker.com /engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/". Downloaded the Eclipse Che from the this('https://www.eclipse.org/che/download/')link. I opened that link and cliced on the "Download unsigned latest release from Codenvy servers (142 MB)" hyperlink to download the zip file of che. Extracted the eclipse-che-4.0.1.zip. And opened a command shell ran the bin/che.sh Opened the mozilla firefox browser and went to this link "http://localhost:8080/dashboard". Now when I click on New Project,I am getting the "Error while creating the project Internal Server Error: fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/che-samples/console-java-simple.git/': Could not resolve host: github.com " error. The workspace will be created but not able to create the project. All the log files have been attached and also a screen shot has been attached. Is there any steps which I am missing during the setup.? Please help to resolve this issue. 1.txt catalina-0log.txt localhost-access-0log.txt machineIdlogs.txt
