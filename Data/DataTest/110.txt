Arm7 Git

I am having trouble with the following error when I hit repo button. From the web I think it is from the cacerts file. I tried to fix this on both the host and machine/container. I ran update-ca-certificates on host and ca-certificates-cacert on arch linux container then saved image. I restarted che too after. I don't know if this is related but I cannot push changes to server. I get unauthorized message. I can do this manually from linux console though. I use the servers IP address instead of localhost because I was getting not found with localhost. https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/git Which cacerts does che use? Host or machince/container? Does it use this location /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts? java.lang.RuntimeException: Unexpected error: java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty
