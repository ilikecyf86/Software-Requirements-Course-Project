Incorporate Eclipse Collections into Che

Hi team. I'm one of the committers of Eclipse Collections project. I was looking into your project code and wondering if you are interested in incorporating Eclipse Collections into your code base. Took a heap dump of Che and its 3rd and 4th largest memory usages are coming from HashMap$Node and HashMap$Node[]. This memory footprint could be significantly reduced by replacing HashMap with UnifiedMap, and HashSet with UnifiedSet from Eclipse Collections. There are number of streams/Collectors usages in code that can be simplified by leveraging our rich APIs. We (Eclipse Collections team) are happy to take up the conversion and submit a pull request if you agree adding Eclipse Collections as a dependency to your project. Please let us know your thoughts!
