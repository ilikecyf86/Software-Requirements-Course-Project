CHE-556 Support packages for Che

This is an autogenerated issue. Original: https://jira.codenvycorp.com/browse/CHE-556 Reporter: Dmytro Nochevnov Description: The goal of this epic is to work on support packages to: help user diagnose and figure what are the configuration problems they are running into. get the ability to download a support package (with logs, configuration status, infos) that they can send us to support. With Che, users are running into some issues that are very similar and support team has to handle that. It would help support team if we can determine a set of pre-checks, so that the product can auto-detect some issues and propose some solutions; Then, if the user haven't been able to solve the problem, he should be able to get all the information (as a support package to download) from a single location (without having to navigate to logs folders...). The pre-checks could be handled: in che.sh in dashboard
