How about supporting Mercurial as a version control tool ?
kind/enhancement kind/question kind/enhancement 
Hi all, Mercurial have strong supporters among the developer community (me, at least, but you can found some of them at Mozilla, Facebook or in the Java community too), so how about writing a plugin for it ? For the moment it's the only issue that prevent my company to use Che instead of our "IDE/Fat client over NX" solution. I'd be glad to help but it has been more than 10 years since I wrote anything in Java, so for the sake of us all, it's better if I don't write it. I previously saw this feature as wanted somewhere on a suggestion page on the web (maybe on the codenvy website, I don't remember) but I don't see anything on GitHub, so here it is ! Anyway Che is a pretty impressive tool, so keep up the good work and thank you !
