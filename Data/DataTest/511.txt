Enhancements to the terminal features
kind/enhancement 
Description of problem: It would be great if the terminal could be setup to create/re-attach to a tmux session (even if this is not the default.) It allows one to get back to where one left off when the browser refreshes. If we can suspend the main machine for a workspace then we can actually re-enter our terminal upon resume. I have this setup with my codenvy runners and find it very useful. I get that you might not want to make this the default behavior, but making it easy for folks to do would be super. It would be nice if we could name our terminal tabs in the UI (rather than Terminal and Terminal-2 we could call them: Java and Node or whatever makes sense.) Of course I can do this with tmux, but it would be a nice feature to have in the UI. Especially if these could be restored after a suspend...
