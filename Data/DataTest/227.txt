Cannot copy and paste text in Terminal in OSX
kind/bug 
Running Codenvy 4 in Chrome on Macbook Air. Cut-n-paste works OK in the IDE java editor using command-c/command-v, but it's impossible to cut-n-paste in the terminal session. This does not seem to be an issue with Chrome in a VMWare Fusion Windows session on the same Mac. Command-c/command-v seems to work ok.
