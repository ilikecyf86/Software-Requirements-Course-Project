CHE-521 Git status output is different if 'Committer' has a name or has not.

This is an autogenerated issue. Original: https://jira.codenvycorp.com/browse/CHE-521 Reporter: Aleksandr Shmaraev Description: * Open IDE and check that git user name(or email) is not set. Open a project, delete git repository (if it is). Initialize repository and check git status. Set the git user name(or email) repeat the actions with repository. Expected: the git status output should be same in the both cases. Actual: the git status output is different.
