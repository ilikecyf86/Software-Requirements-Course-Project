Uncaught exception when start eclipse-che.exe in win7

I've installed docker toolbox as Usage Server and download eclipse-che-4.0.1 from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/che/eclipse-che-4.0.1.zip&r=1. Then I try to start eclipse-che.exe following https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/usage-windows . But I get following problems: And when I click 确定, nothing appears. My operating system information as following: Computer name and product id have been erased on purpose, other information is real.
