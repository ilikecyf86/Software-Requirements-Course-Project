Very long startup due to entropy gathering
kind/enhancement status/open-for-dev 
Che main process takes a very long time to startup - sometimes up to 10 minutes - because it uses blocking entropy gathering. 2016-02-24 18:51:30,108[ost-startStop-1] [INFO ] [o.a.c.u.SessionIdGeneratorBase 241] - Creation of SecureRandom instance for session ID generation using [SHA1PRNG] took [449,673] milliseconds. 2016-02-24 18:51:30,335[main] [INFO ] [o.a.catalina.startup.Catalina 638] - Server startup in 453752 ms This is unnecessary for a lot of development environments (and is absolutely infuriating when trying to get che working in the first place!) and there should be an option in che.sh to bypass it. It can be bypassed by (on linux, at least) by simply adding this environment setting before running che.sh: export JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom" Result: Startup takes 5 seconds instead of 7.5 minutes. 2016-02-24 18:52:35,449[main] [INFO ] [o.a.catalina.startup.Catalina 638] - Server startup in 4266 ms
