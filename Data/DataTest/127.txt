Workspace Connection Error eclipse-che-4.2.0
kind/question 
Hello, I already have eclipse-che-4.0.0-RC11 and I can create projects. Now I try to update its version so I have downloaded eclipse-che-4.2.0 to test: I have the same error each time when starting the workspace agent: "Workspace connection error" (see error in detail below). I run che with: bin/che.sh run. I am on ubuntu 14.04. Can it be because of the previous che version? What changed between the two versions that could justify this error? And to be honest, I also tried the unsigned nightly (eclipse-che-4.3.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT), that gives the error "Error: Can't load project types: Error: 404 Not Found http://localhost:8080 at ... see detailed picture". Error 4.2.0 in detail: Workspace Connection Error It seems that your workspace is running, but we cannot connect your browser to it. This commonly happens when Che was not configured properly. If your browser is connecting to workspaces running remotely, then you must start Che with the --remote: flag where the is the IP address of the node that is running your Docker workspaces.Please restart Che with this flag. You can read about what this flag does and why it is essential at: https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/configuration#envrionment-variables.
