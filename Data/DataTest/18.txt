non workspace machines don't have project code
kind/enhancement 
I'd like to create a custom recipe in which I use to create runtimes to execute my code. (I need to install a bunch of python dependencies like Tensorflow). I created a custom recipe and create a machine from that recipe. However, when I start a terminal in that machine my code isn't sync'd into /projects. I tried this with the debian8_jdk recipe to make sure it wasn't my recipe. Is it possible to have multiple machines running that are syncing the project code? Thanks J
