Avoid "Contact support" wording in error messages
Improvement kind/enhancement Improvement 
_1 Upvote_ It's a bit confusing to stumble upon error messages asking to "contact support", when running OSS Che. I think those error messages could be improved to point people to GH, or wherever you think support for Che "happens" :-) 12:13 $ ack 'contact support' -i

202:                    "or file system corruption. Please contact support for assistance.", FWW, regarding the "Cannot launch terminal" error, my impression is this might be cause by a workspace machine not exposing port 4411, correct? so maybe that particular message could be changed in that direction?
