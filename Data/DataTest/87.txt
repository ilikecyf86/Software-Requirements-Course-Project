WebSocket che-host failed

Sorry for bothering, but i've been up for the past 5+ hours and cannot get this working I have everything working, until it comes to injecting and starting the workspace agent. It says paste the below stacktrace so here it goes [STDOUT] 2016-05-19 05:44:21,611[ventBusClient-0] [WARN ] [.c.a.c.n.WSocketEventBusClient 256] - Not able to connect to ws://che-host:8080/ide/api/eventbus/?token=dummy_token because Connection timeout.

 It never gets passed this part Deploying web application archive /home/user/che/ws-agent/webapps/ide.war I've uninstalled everything, been trying to tickle with it to get it working and nothing. I've managed to increase my timeout since it says that things might be running slow, But i guess not. After that this happens. Unable to start workspace agent. Error when trying to start the workspace agent: Timeout reached. The Che server has been unable to verify that your workspace's agent has successfully booted. Either the workspace is unreachable, the agent had an error during startup, or your workspace is starting slowly. You can configure machine.ws_agent.max_start_time_ms in Che properties to increase the timeout.
 Also, everytime when I run che after being closed it says this Could not find an existing docker machine.
Creating docker machine named default... Please be patient, this takes a couple minutes the first time.
 Then, when I load the che localhost:8080 nothing is saved that was previously created. How can I load whats default instead of it creating one every single time? Thanks for the support
