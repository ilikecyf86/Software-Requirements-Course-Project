Running che and docker daemon in 2 separate VMs
kind/question 
Che: 4.0.0-RC12 Docker: 1.9.10 I have separate che and docker daemon in 2 VMs. (I'm in a cloud context) It's mean that che can only talk to docker with the vm IP which running docker daemon and containers talk to che only with api. The docker vm have the ws-agent.zip and terminal folder to mount all necessary files in the container all this things works correctly. But the issue is that the folder /projects in container have permissions only user root: I'm also have 409 conflict response when creating java projects (php seems to work for example but i see user www-data is set on the folder /projects) I suspect that when using che in one vm and docker in other one permissions are not propagated (which seems normal that these permissions are not propagated over the network ) Che process is running with a user with uid 1000 and its owned by docker group. Someone have an idea to have needed permissions set ? Maybe it's not possible to run che and docker daemon ? Cause the docs (see: https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/networking ) do not show how to separate che and docker machine. The only close enough is the Native Process for Che, VM Docker for Workspaces network but I get it's a vm inside the machine which is running che, it's not my case.
