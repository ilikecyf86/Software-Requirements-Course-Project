Poor performance running JGit Maven build in Che workspace
kind/question 
install Che 4.0.0 RC11 on Mac OS X 10.11.3 create a new project for jgit, choose 2GB RAM for the workspace, this should be sufficient since the local maven build says it used 470MB clone jgit git repository from https://git.eclipse.org/r/jgit/jgit open project in Che open terminal in Che run $mvn install in root folder of jgit's source tree -> build and tests take ~54min, directly on my Mac this takes around 4min ! Default machine configuration for the VirtualBox machine seems to be 1 core. I tried to change that to 4 cores in order to see if this changes performance. Verified in che terminal that cat /proc/cpuinfo now shows 4 cores. It seems this doesn't improve performance for the Maven build Another issue is that after restarting the workspace the Maven repository located in the docker image is lost. This means the next build after restarting the image has to again download a lot of dependencies which takes a while. How could I change the configuration to mount the Maven repository on the host similarly like /projects is mounted ?
