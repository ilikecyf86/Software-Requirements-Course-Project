This is an autogenerated issue. Original: https://jira.codenvycorp.com/browse/CHE-531 Reporter: Maxim Musienko Description: In the ide on this moment we do not have full list of commands for git operations (like stash, rebase and etc.). For this we can use console git. In my case i have added user name and e-mail in the git preferences. After i opened console git and tried to did stash - operation . But got unexpected message: *git config --global user.email "you@example.com" git config --global user.name "Your Name" to set your account's default identity. Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository. fatal: empty ident name (for <user@822fa423a8d9.(none)>) not allowed *
