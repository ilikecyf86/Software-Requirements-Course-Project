Class not found.

Trying to get server/client setup with Vaadin working with debugger in che. From what I have read, I have to create a connector component in a separate class the connect to main class. If there are any existing projects that work with Vaadin and debugger please let me know as it might be easier than trying to get this to work. Thanks. FYI. I have been able to get the debugger to connect but just trying to figure out how to make server callbacks as everything seems to be executed in client right now.
