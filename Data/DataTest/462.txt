CHE-517 When a container is shut down due to no or corrupted CMD a weird error is displayed

This is an autogenerated issue. Original: https://jira.codenvycorp.com/browse/CHE-517 Reporter: Eugene Ivantsov Description: Steps to reproduce: In Che, create a custom stack with the following recipe FROM codenvy/ubuntu_jre Run it The following error is printed: [STDERR] nsenter: Unable to fork: Cannot allocate memory Machine is destroyed. Dashboard displays an out of memory error in a popup. This base image does not have CMD. So, Docker executed FROM instruction and shut image down. Also, if you make a mistake in CMD, for instance provide a non existing command, the result will be the same, and a user will never know that it is a bad command that has caused it. Maybe it will make sense to analyze docker run exit code? https://github.com/sallyom/docker/blob/41de7a18d8f231568977e66bb58a6a02545d49d9/docs/reference/run.md#exit-status
