Build docker image failed

I tried to build the docker image: cd che
docker build -t freewind/che:try1 .
 But it fails: Step 8 : ADD /assembly-ide/target/eclipse-che-*/eclipse-che-* /home/user/che
No source files were specified
 Do I need to do something else before building? (e.g. mvn clean install)
