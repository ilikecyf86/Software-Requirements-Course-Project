Need guide for Maven Usage
kind/question 
I am having a heck of a time trying to get the Java/Maven integration working with our project. We don't use Maven (buildr actually) so I've attempted drafting pom.xml files to make Che discover modules and whatnot, and more often than not, either Che will delete the whole project when reloading the workspace, or it will render a submodule/child completely invisible in the UI. I've tried figuring out how to skulk around delete stuff so I can try again (i.e. the .codenvy folders littered about) but it doesn't help. I have used the che repo's pom.xml files as a reference. I've tried to do it all thru the 'Create Project' and 'New => Maven Module' dialog(s) and by manually creating pom.xml files with a little success, but (way) more often than not its unsuccessful. I'd rather not use Maven, but afaict it seems to be the only option to get Che to pull down external dependencies and make a project's java source editable. We have Eclipse .classpath and IntelliJ idea files littered about, is there any way I can use those?!
