Workspace project storage created with insecure permissions
kind/enhancement 
Where -che- is the root of the app, -che-/workspaces/-workspace- and -che-/workspaces/-workspace-/-project- are both created with 777 permissions. It is also owned by 33:33 which isn't correct, but the permissions is much more serious issue.
