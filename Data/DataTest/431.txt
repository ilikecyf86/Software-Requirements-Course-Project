Can't create a new workspace
kind/question 
I'm currently running Che as a server (not run in a container) on Debian Jessy. I am using Che 4.0.0-RC3 downloaded from the eclipse website as a targz. The Che dashboard is working properly on 8080 so I am assuming that the configuration is good for that part, I am accessing it throught another computer. I was also able to play with some docker container (create/delete/run...) with the same user I am launching Che with so I am also assuming that docker is properly configured too... I try to create a new workspace from the web interface but when I press "RUN" nothing is happenning but the following output in the terminal 2016-02-19 10:33:12,624[kspaceManager-0] [INFO ] [o.e.c.a.m.s.MachineManager 167] - Creating machine [ws = workspacewm59mabzwnrhwg0h: env = wksp-jwl5: machine = ws-mac Che is running with the following command ./che.sh -s:uid -r:x.x.x.x run Full execution trace with exception When doing docker ps -a there is only my registry container, it seems like absolutely no docker command are issued from Che. Does anybody got this error?
