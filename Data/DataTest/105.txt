Simplify Docker Execution
kind/enhancement 
This is a tracking issue for a range of improvements that will make it simpler for people who want to run Che within a Docker container using docker run syntax. The specification is: Change the default location of JSON storage for defining workspaces, projects and other internal models from che.conf.storage=${catalina.base}/temp/local-storage to che.conf.storage=${che.home}/storage. Change the default Docker run syntax to volume mount the ${che.home}/storage instead of the tomcat directory. Change the Dockerfile for Che to have the Entrypoint be the Che script and removing some magic around copying library files to be mounted outside of the container. Make it possible for every Che script configuration parameter to be set through an environment variable, so that they can be provided as part of docker run syntax with -e override. Allow users to override the automatic determination of the location of $CHE_HOME within the Dockerfile to use a set of Che binaries that are mounted into the container instead of those contained within it. Create a second default Vagrantfile that demonstrates the various usages of running Che in a Docker container. Deprecate the --image syntax from within the che.sh script. If you want to run Che as a docker image, you must do it manually with Docker run syntax. Add "Launch in Cloud" option for Che Docker container. Add in checks into che.sh script to detect if Docker for windows or mac is installed. If it is installed, skip the docker-machine and virtualbox steps, which are unnecessary. @garagatyi @eivantsov @riuvshin - FYI. I'll work on issues for all of these.
