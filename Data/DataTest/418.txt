This is an autogenerated issue. Original: https://jira.codenvycorp.com/browse/CHE-566 Reporter: St√©van Le Meur Description: We need to prototype the animation and the transition for the right part of the loader. !Screen Shot 2016-02-22 at 10.20.24.png! We will have map the animation to similar ones from an accordion menu. We will keep each steps expandable/collapsable. As an option (not mandatory to start), we would like the console being collapsible/expandable as well.
