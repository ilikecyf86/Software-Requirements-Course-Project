This is an autogenerated issue. Original: https://jira.codenvycorp.com/browse/CHE-662 Reporter: Alexander Garagatyi Description: Now it is hard and dangerous to migrate (support) new docker/swarm versions. These products introduce significant chages in API quite ofthen. Also it is not rera case when this products have long-running bugs or unobvious behavior. We need tests that ensures that used version of docker does exactly what we expected. It will allow us to make migration to newer versions bug-free.
