workspace not restored from snapshot when che server is restarted
kind/bug 
Description of problem: Snapshots let users capture, save, and re-constitute this state. Make snapshots for workspace machines, which are stored as Docker images in a configured registry. Reopening the workspace instantiates a new workspace machine from the snapshot with the projects then mounted. This leads to superior long term performance as snapshot re-activation is immediate. I am running Che natively on Windows 7. A "snapshotted" workspace stops after stopping Che. When Che starts up again, booting up the workspace in the process, the workspace doesn't get restored from the snapshot. However, when the workspace is stopped from within the browser client, it prompts to restore from snapshot on the next start. Che version: Version: 4.0.0-RC12

How reproducible: Using Firefox Firefox ESR 38.7.0, 100% reproducible. Steps to Reproduce: Create a workspace and start it up Install a ruby gem or an npm package using the terminal Snapshot the workspace Stop the workspace and che server Restart Che server which automatically starts up the workspace in step 4 Actual Results: The packages installed on to the workspace machine prior to creating snapshot are not available. Expected Results: Workspace has to restore from snapshot after Che restart.
