How to restrict the number of workspaces that can be created? Or enable only one workspace running at the same time
kind/enhancement New feature New feature 
Hello, here is my concern: I would like to create several Che instances on the same host. In order to do that, I will modify each time the ports to use (did it only for 4 users for the moment). But the idea is to be able to control the number of ports and know how many people can be hosted on a single host (and have the maximum number of Che instances). Nevertheless here come the workspaces. Indeed, a user can create as much as workspaces he wants and docker picks the workspace ports in the ephemeral port range. So here comes my question: can we control by a way or another the number of workspaces running simultaneously? The ideas that come in my mind would be to: Restrict the number of workspaces a user can have (say 10 for example) enable only one workspace running at the same time for one Che instance (when one is running, the others are stopped) Maybe you have a better idea, something already implemented (the must),... I take everything!
