Unable to use Git menu in IDE
kind/bug kind/question kind/bug 
Hello, While using Che I noticed that I am no longer able to use most of Git menu options (I don't usually use it so I didn't noticed it immediately). Even after initialized Git repository I can't add a remote server or do any request (fetch, pull, commit...), Git is installed in the workspace (PHP standard stack from codenvy dockerfile) and I am able to perform Git operation using the embedded terminal so Git is perfectly working I'm on Che builded version from master branch (2 days ago) Here is a snapshot Is there a similar issue known for that problem, how can I help you to provide more information. Thank. PS: I'm not very familiar with Git yet so I may have made a mistake...
