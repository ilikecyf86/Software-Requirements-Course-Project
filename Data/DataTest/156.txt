Setup Ubuntu server - Virtualbox

Hi, I've installed the latest Che version on a Ubuntu server VM running on Virtualbox Server version : Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS Kernel version : 4.2.0-35-generic Java version installed : 1.8.0_77-b03 Docker server version installed : 1.10.3 Docker client version installed : 1.10.3 Virtualbox : 5.0.16 r105871 Port forwarding on port 8080 has been set up in order to be accessible from the host system I manage to get Eclipse Che started and can access it via my browser I choose to create a new simple HelloWorld Java project After doing this I get the build screen but the process get stucked at "Inject and start workspace agent" I get this message I increased the timeout in the conf/che.properties file however I keep getting this error What I'm missing that this doesn't work. I was able to create an empty Java container and get to the IDE but there the workspace agent remains in initializing and when I create a small program I'm also not able to display the console. So it looks like i'm missing something ? Any advice ? Or doesn't it work with this kind of setup? Thank you in advance for the help and feedback! Tom
