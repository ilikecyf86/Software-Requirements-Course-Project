CHE-616 Add ability validate name of files and folders which user creates on file system
dev 
This is an autogenerated issue. Original: https://jira.codenvycorp.com/browse/CHE-616 Reporter: Dmitry Shnurenko Description: For now we can not validate name of files and folders which user creates on file system without our IDE. It would be nice to notify user that he created file or folder by hand with incorrect name. Now when we create file or folder with incorrect name our IDE can not open it.
