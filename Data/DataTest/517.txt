Cannot checkout private GitHub repository

Hi, I just installed Eclipse Che locally and I have an issue while trying to checkout a Github private repo. Here is what I did : Added authorized application with Authorization callback URL to my GitHub account Added GitHub OAuth credentials in che.properties Organization access is green (no restrictions) Used Github icon in Preferences>SSH>Git to automatically generate SSH key and upload it to the Github account (I can see it labeled as Codenvy SSH Key) At that point I can list all the projects from my Github account when importing from Eclipse Che but still I get this error while trying to check out a private repo (public repo works) : Unauthorized: You are not authorized to perform the remote import. You may need to provide accurate keys to the external system. You can create a new SSH key pair in Window->Preferences->Keys And Certificates->SSH Keystore. Not sure if this is a bug or configuration issue on my side. Thanks! P.S. : I don't see any logs in GitHub Security history regarding SSH keys while trying to checkout a repo (like a verify or something...)
