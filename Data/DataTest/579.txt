Can't connect to ws://che-host:8080 when creating new project

I started a new che by docker run -it --privileged -p 8080:8080 codenvy/che:nightly, then open the dashboard: http://myip:8080/dashboard, and create the first project. But it fails: The error information is: [STDOUT] 2016-01-01 03:21:42,614[rrest.WSClient8] [INFO ] [.c.a.c.n.WSocketEventBusClient 223] - Open connection to ws://che-host:8080/che/api/eventbus/?token=dummy_token.
