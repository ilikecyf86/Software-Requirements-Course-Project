Hello...I try to set up che at ec2 in ASW. And I build che and start che and test for making work space and project. In 2 step, I chose READY-TO-GO STACKS(JAVA) and select templete(console-java-simple) and create project. Next time I get a processing 1~4. After 3 step(Injecting and starting workspace agent), it print [STDOUT] 2016-01-25 09:10:13,645[main] [INFO ] [o.a.catalina.startup.Catalina 638] - Server startup in 17124 ms but can't Create project(Step4) But it make work-space. So I Choose the stack itself(Step2 STACK LIBRARY). And process create project. It print console-java-simple : Project created. And I go to the opin in IDE. It print "connection failed with terminal" Why it happend? doest it need to change property? i Change machine.docker.che_api.endpoint=myIP api.endpoint=miIP:${SERVER_PORT}/ide/api I'm not used to docker and che. So if you need any information. Please tell me..
