Cannot connect Agent when creating workspace: cannot find or open /mnt/che/ws-agent.zip

Running: docker run -p 80:8080 -p 8000:8000 -p 49152-49162:49152-49162 -v /var/run/ docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock codenvy/che on a GCE and trying to create a new workspace shows an error in the web UI of Che: [STDERR] unzip: cannot find or open /mnt/che/ws-agent.zip, /mnt/che/ws-agent.zip.zip or /mnt/che/ws-agent.zip.ZIP.
 The log shows: 2016-06-22 14:40:15,953[kspaceManager-0]  [ERROR] [o.e.c.a.w.s.WorkspaceManager 549]    - Timeout reached. The Che server has been unable to verify that your workspace's agent has successfully booted. Either the workspace is unreachable, the agent had an error during startup, or your workspace is starting slowly. You can configure machine.ws_agent.max_start_time_ms in Che properties to increase the timeout.
 Which port is the agent using? Must it be accessible from the internet?
