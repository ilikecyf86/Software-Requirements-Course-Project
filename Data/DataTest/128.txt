Using che-install-plugin.sh to install example IDE plugin
kind/bug 
Hi I built Che and the simple IDE extension from source. I then copied the che-examples-action-.jar into the plugins/ide folder of the Che assembly. Then I ran the che-install-plugin.sh command, which seemed to detect the plugin: CHE SDK: Adding IDE extensions as dependencies Extension found org.eclipse.che:che-examples-action:4.2.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT Including GWT module examples.MyExtension Found: 1 extension(s) However, when I started up the server in the new'y build plugins/assembly/target folder, and opened the brower, created a workspace, etc, it didn't show the My Action menu item. When looking at the documentation on https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/developing-extensions IDE Extension Example, it only talks about manually changing the maven files, etc, before doing a build - but I assume that these steps were automatically being performed by the che-install-plugin.sh script? If that is correct, any ideas what I have missed? Thanks in advance.
