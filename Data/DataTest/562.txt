Running 'docker' succeeded, but 'docker ps' failed. This usually means that docker cannot reach its daemon. Looks like something went wrong. Possible issues: (Win | Mac) VirtualBox not installed ==> Rerun Docker Toolbox installation (Win | Mac) Docker Machine not installed ==> Rerun Docker Toolbox installation (Win | Mac) Docker is not reachable ==> Docker VM failed to start (Win | Mac) Docker ok, but docker ps fails ==> Docker environment variables not set properly (Linux) Docker is not reachable ==> Install: wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh (Linux) Permissions not properly set ==> Che must run as UID 1000 with user in docker group Could not find the Che app server ==> Did /tomcat get moved away from CHE_HOME? Wrong version of Java found ==> Che requires Java 1.8 Did you use the right parameter syntax? ==> See usage We have seen issues with VirtualBox on Windows where your VM gets corrupted when your computer is suspended while the VM is still running. This will appear as SSH or ethernet connection issues. This is rare, but if encountered, current known solution is to uninstall VirtualBox and Docker Toolbox, and then reinstall. Che Environment Variables: (REQUIRED) JAVA_HOME ==> Location of Java runtime (REQUIRED: WIN|MAC) DOCKER_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_PATH ==> Location of Docker Toolbox (REQUIRED: WIN|MAC) VBOX_MSI_INSTALL_PATH ==> Location of VirtualBox (OPTIONAL) CHE_HOME ==> Directory where Che is installed (OPTIONAL) CHE_LOCAL_CONF_DIR ==> Directory with custom Che .properties files (OPTIONAL) CHE_LOGS_DIR ==> Directory for Che output logs (OPTIONAL) CHE_DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME ==> (Win | Mac) Name of VM created by docker-machine (OPTIONAL) DOCKER_MACHINE_HOST ==> (Linux) Docker host IP - set if browser clients remote Usage: che [OPTIONS] [run | start | stop] -i, --image Launches Che within a Docker container using latest image -i:tag, --image:tag Launches Che within a Docker container using specific image tag -p:port, --port:port Port that Che server will use for HTTP requests; default=8080 -r:ip, --remote:ip If Che clients are not localhost, set to IP address of Che server -m:vm, --machine:vm For Win & Mac, sets the docker-machine VM name to vm; default=default -s, --suppress Do not print browser client connection information -h, --help Show this help -d, --debug Use debug mode (prints command line options + app server debug) run Starts Che application server in current console start Starts Che application server in new console stop Stops Che application server The -r flag sets the DOCKER_MACHINE_HOST system environment variable. Set this to the IP address of the node that is running your Docker daemon. Only necessary to set this if on Linux and your browser clients are not localhost, ie they are remote. This property automatically set for Che on Windows and Mac.
