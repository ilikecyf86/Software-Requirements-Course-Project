IDE don't save Java compiler preferences after stop workspace
kind/bug 
Steps to reproduce: Go to: Profile -> Preferences -> Java Compiler Set value "error" for properties: "Value of local variable is not used": . Click "Save" button. Create new project from Spring sample. Open project and wait until IDE resolves dependensies. Open GreetingController class from created project. Add code "int l = 0;" to the method "handleRequest"; IDE should create error marker for added code line. Go to machine perspective. Select Machine -> stop Refresh page with IDE. Wait until ide will be initialized. Open Spring project. Open GreetingController class. Actual result: line with code "int l = 0;" contains warning marker, because IDE didn't store java compiler preference and got default preferences. Expected result: line with code "int l = 0;" sholud contains error marker
