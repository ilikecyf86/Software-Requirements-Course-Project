Codenvy beta installs the entire OS after container stopped, causing huge startup delays

It is taking 10+ minutes to start an existing workspace on the Codenvy Beta while it only takes a couple of seconds to start Che on a local machine after first install. This is unacceptable as Che should have better performance on a server class machine than on a local host. It appears that perhaps the caching features of Docker aren't being used properly or are being bypassed by the Codenvy infrastructure. For caching best practices: https://www.ctl.io/developers/blog/post/more-docker-image-cache-tips/ There are also documented issues with Vagrant and Docker, and led to the development of vagrant-cachier. It is actually guaranteed to reduce the amount of coffee consumed while waiting for docker images to load on Vagrant: http://fgrehm.viewdocs.io/vagrant-cachier/ Also, an apt-cache proxy would help speed the initial installation for any Debian clones: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptProxy
