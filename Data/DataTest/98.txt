GWT super dev mode not working

I am trying to configure GWT superdev mode to work with Eclipse Che. Here are my configurations Main tab Program arguments -noincremental -src target/generated-sources/gen com.google.gwt.core.Core Classpath I'm getting the following error when I run this Super Dev Mode starting up
  workDir: /tmp/gwt-codeserver-4526277433637069313.tmp
   Job com.google.gwt.core.Core_1_0
     Loading inherited module 'com.google.gwt.core.Core'
         [ERROR] Unable to find 'com/google/gwt/core/Core.gwt.xml' on your classpath; could be a typo, or maybe you forgot to include a classpath entry for source?
 I am using 4.3.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT
