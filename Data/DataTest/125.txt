JREContainer hashcode implementation

In che/plugins/plugin-java/che-plugin-java-ext-jdt/org-eclipse-jdt-ui/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/jdt/core/launching/JREContainer.java , Class RuleEntry does not implements hashcode() while it overrides equals(). According to Java API` If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. So, in this case it is necessary to implement hashcode() too.
