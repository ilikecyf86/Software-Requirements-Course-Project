Autocomplete not working no idea why, not sure how to debug
kind/question kind/enhancement 
Description of problem: I have a maven project in Che, I ran Update dependencies. First time it failed without any error messages in the outputs panel (although it appeared to be frozen, so maybe it was a timeout). There was an event indicating a failure.I ran it a second time and it appeared to complete in the outputs panel and a success event was added. At this point I opened some of my java files and attempted to goto definition and to autocomplete (implicitly and explicitly ... assume the keyboard shortcut is control-tab?) In any case non of this worked and there were no errors I could find (even looking in the console where the Che container was running) to help me find out why it was failing.
