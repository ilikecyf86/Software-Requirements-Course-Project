Can not open project in IDE
kind/question 
CentOS 7.2.1511,docker 1.8.2-10, SELinux disabled I have created projects in workspace,but I can't open it in IDE. Doing this, I got an error message like: "window.IDE.eventHandlers.initializationFailed@http://10.74.154.144:8080/ide/wksp-test?uid=325635:39......" and I also find that there was no workspace info in project's setting. My che is the nightly build on 2016/01/31. Thanks a lot!
