Question: How is a dockerfile used with a stack? Can we use the --privileged notion or the --device?
kind/question 
I launch eclipse che in docker thanks to this command: docker run -ti --net=host -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /home/user/che/lib:/home/user/che/lib-copy -v /home/user/che/workspaces:/home/user/che/workspaces -v /home/user/che/tomcat/temp/local-storage:/home/user/che/tomcat/temp/local-storage codenvy/che Then, I have defined a new custom stack based on a custom docker image that installs Intel OpenCL drivers, here no problem. But for Nvidia OpenCL drivers, we need to authorize device access thanks to --device if the image was run with a docker run --device command. How is the image run in order to create the workspace? How can we authorize the devices (in /dev). Yes, I obviously don't completely undestand the use of the stacks!
