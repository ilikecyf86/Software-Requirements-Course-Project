Add enhancements for working with files not added as projects
kind/question 
Having a, Docker by default, sharable runtime is a cool concept. However could you explain a bit how practically it's expected to work. I've many projects using Python/PHP/... and none of them would run out of the box on one of the preset runtime. However most websites (I'm focusing here mostly on websites here) builds generate a few Docker images. Those images can get deployed or run locally with local folder mounted to develop. So how is it supposed to work? Using existing preset seems not to include what I need (that's fine IMO). Sure I could add all packages required by the various images into a single Dockerfile that would allow to run all components. This would require keeping them in sync and increases the risk also of having something behave differently in production. Use a very basic Dockerfile for Che that can do Docker-in-Docker and basically continue like I'm coding. This isn't a bad solution. Both are fine, I was mostly wondering if you'd mind explaining a bit some practical usage examples and especially detail how to build a Dockerfile for Che. When I tried I had an error but no details (using Codenvy), so I can only guess I'm missing some app that is expected on it.
