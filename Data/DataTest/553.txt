Cannot create new workspace
kind/question 
_1 Upvote_ I am not able to create a new workspace. I try to create a new one using web java spring starter sample project. I get a timeout error on the UI at the step that says "Injecting and starting workspace agent". My env is - Che 4.0.0-beta-12, Win 7, JDK 1.8, Git 2.7.0, Virtual Box 5.0.14, Docker 1.9.1, docker-machine 0.5.6 Snippet of log from the step - "Injecting and starting workspace agent" [STDOUT] 2016-01-24 08:51:01,430[ost-startStop-1]  [INFO ] [o.a.c.startup.HostConfig 980]        - Deployment of web application archive /home/user/che/ws-agent/webapps/ide.war has finished in 18,387 ms

 The che server is running as a java process on the Win 7 host machine, while the workspace container seems to be running in side a docker container in the 'default' docker machine VM in VirtualBox. In the workspace container che-host resolves to 192.168.99.1. After some googleing and through some trial and error I find I can get it working by updating che.properties as below: #machine.docker.che_api.endpoint=http://che-host:8080/ide/api
machine.docker.che_api.endpoint=http://10.0.2.2:8080/ide/api
