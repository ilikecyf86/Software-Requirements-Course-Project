Not able to create new project using any stack
kind/question 
I upgraded to eclipse che 4.2.0 and have been trying to create workspace and project using python3.5 stack. The workspace gets created successfully but when I try to create project, it doesn't seem to do anything and after a while retry option appears. I don't see any message on the console during the create project task. However, in the log downloaded from the link provided on UI page, it appears that client unexpectedly aborts. Please refer to the log files attached. Tried with Java stack too to verify if this issue is only with Python stack or exists in in general and it didn't work for Java either. Am attaching the log for this one too which of course similar to the other one. ubuntu_jdk8.txt ubuntu_python.txt
