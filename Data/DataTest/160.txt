Unable to create project from wizard in new workspace
kind/bug 
Che Version: Nightly build 4.1.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT Revision: a21f016 OS: Windows Steps to reproduce error: Start Che Navigate to the dashboard and click "Projects" Click the + icon in the upper right-hand corner Select the following options to create a project and new workspace at the same time: Source: New from blank, template, or sample project Stack: Java CentOS Template: Wizard-driven Click "Create Project" Click "Open Project in IDE" Select "Python Project" and click "Create" Result: The "Create" button changes to a loading icon that just hangs. Inspecting the Dev Console shows that a POST request was made to http://localhost:8080/ide/ext/project/workspacejv7cvewr2n58n63l and received a response of 409 - Path for new project should be defined. However, if instead of creating the project and workspace at the same time I create the workspace by itself, open the workspace in the IDE, select "Create Project" from the "Workspace" menu, and then try to build a Python project, then everything works perfectly.
