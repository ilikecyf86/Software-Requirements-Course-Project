Question: port range to open in amazon instance
kind/question 
Hello, I have a short question: on your website you say that we need to open ports 32768-65535. Nethertheless I've encountered some discussions on the net that say that we only need ports 32768-32788. What is the good answer (the idea would be to expose the less ports possible) And another question: is it possible to only open port 8080? I know it is possible locally by doing this: Create a copy of /conf/che.properties file and modify: machine.docker.che_api.endpoint=http://172.17.0.1:8080/ide/api Launch Che with modified Docker command docker run -ti -p 8080:8080 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /home/user/che/lib:/home/user/che/lib-copy -v /home/user/che/workspaces:/home/user/che/workspaces -v /home/user/che/tomcat/temp/local-storage:/home/user/che/tomcat/temp/local-storage -v $(pwd)/che.properties:/home/user/.che/che.properties -e CHE_DOCKER_MACHINE_HOST=172.17.0.1 codenvy/che But this is not applicable when che must be reached by remote clients, right?
