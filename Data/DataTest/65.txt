Can't install eclipse on Mac OS X "El Capitan"

I decided to install Eclipse on my Macbook Air. So I do the download, get the Eclipse installer, and get the warning that JVM 1.6.0_065 is unsuitable. Well, OK, I didn't install Java first. So I do this. I download the very-latest-as-of-today JDK for Java SE. So now, I should have everything I need. Nope, same error. I follow the instructions of how to uninstall Java, and do what they tell me. I then reinstall the JDK for Java. Nope, same error. I search for jvm, jre, etc. and discover nothing that seems to refer to these installations. While I am a gray-bearded programmer (53+ years in the profession), I haven't used Eclipse in many years, and I didn't do the installation myself, and it was on a Windows machine. And the wench is dead. Or something like that. What do I have to do to install a Java development environment on my Macbook Air? I'm using the "El Capitan" release of OS X.
