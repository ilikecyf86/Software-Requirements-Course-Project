Create project error: Client has aborted connection
kind/question 
Che-version: 4.0.0-RC8 When creating i had this kind of error during Injecting and starting workspace agent : Client has aborted connection. Response writing omitted. After read this: https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/networking I get that I had to specified my host and port to make it work. i change those values api.endpoint and machine.docker.che_api.endpoint, it seems to work as we can see in the trace during Injecting and starting workspace agent: [STDOUT] 2016-03-04 13:04:40,847[rrest.WSClient1]  [INFO ] [.c.a.c.n.WSocketEventBusClient 223]  - Open connection to ws://10.203.7.51:8080/ide/api/eventbus/?token=dummy_token.

 so, I continued to investigate and i found that when i tried to go to my workspace with the browser (e.g: http://10.203.7.51:8080/dashboard/#/workspace/workspacetv9s56bvl46huqvm <- this an internal url it will not work if you click on it) and tried to see what's happen in network connection panel I found this: It seems the ip is not change (Here it's still 127.0.0.1), do I miss a parameter to set the good ip ? Is it a bug on che version 4.0.0-RC8 ? Btw, this is related to my project https://github.com/ArthurHlt/codenvy-che-boshrelease this kind be interesting for you, the goal to this project is to be able to make run che on any IaaS by using bosh (a deployment tool for any IaaS made by Pivotal), this will be reversed to https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community EDIT: Forgot to say that I've also tried to directly hit 10.203.7.51:8080 from the container and it's worked
