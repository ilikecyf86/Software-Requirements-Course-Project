Reset to defaults
kind/enhancement 
I was having some issues getting certain things to work on eclipse che server. Workspaces were not loading, IDE would not load project from git, and others I cannot remember. I decided to remove the untarred folder I was running the server from and put a fresh copy from the same tar file. Now everything works again. Not sure what saved data/preferences were causing all these issues but I was wondering if there would be some way to reset che server by deleting all user created data. I know there is a way to do this from the terminal but it would be nice to be able to do this within che IDE running on the web browser. This might also make it easier to track down problem other are having by just telling them to first reset che server back to default. They would lose their workspace(s) though. Wish the was a way to import/restore a workspace. Maybe a feature to export/import workspaces to dockerhub or other storage service. Will open another issue to ask for this separate.
