Shared workspaces

Yesterday we had one meeting related to sharing workspace feature and Major feature what we've discussed was url format in ide. Now it looks like http://codenvy.com/ws/workspacename Since we decided to move from workspace owner's model to permission-based model we think it would be logical to move to another url schema. Our proposal is to make url to looks like this http://codenvy.com/ws/namespace/workspacename To make it possible to reference workspace with "readable" URL (as requested) and keep workspace name meaningful (not make user to invent some name for the sake of uniqueness) we need some prefix - a namespace for it. Apparently this namespace (same as workspace name itself) should be URL path friendly to not to encode (making unreadable) it. This namespace can be bound to: username (the simplest way we start with) account (organization or personal) which "owns" the workspace (strictly speaking which owns resources this workspace uses) - will be implemented along with organization/account things And should be a standalone field "Namespace" to be filled in Account profile.
