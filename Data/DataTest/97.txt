Not able to import new project from github by organization application OAuth and get empty log

I've repackaged eclipse che with mvn clean install under che/assembly from https://github.com/eclipse/che and no error occurred. Then I uncompressed the tarball che\assembly\assembly-main\target\eclipse-che-4.2.2.zip and started it by command che -p:80 run. My workspace can be started normally. But when I tried to import project from github, it failed. I'.m using organization application OAuth instead of personal application OAuth. And I'm the owner of this organization. Afterwards, I tried to get some information about this failure from downloading log file by click Problems?download the logs. but it turned out a blank file. By the way, I'm doing this in chrome observer mode. Here is the screen capture. I'm on windows 7 64 bits.
