Problem on debugging of IDE extension
kind/question 
Description Hi guys, I’m facing some problems during debug. I prepared a little test to extend the ide in order to manage a new file extension and opening it on editor but customizing the syntax highlighting. I’m using the 5.21.0-Snapshot and I started from this example: https://github.com/lgas/fpp-editor Unfortunately I’m stuck, because adding the method with syntax regex in order to customize the highlighting the file doesn’t show the editor page , instead if I remove this method from the class https://github.com/lgas/fpp-editor/blob/master/plugins/che-plugin-fpp-editor/che-plugin-fpp-editor-ide/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/plugin/fpp/editor/ide/FppJSEditorExtension.java All work fine and the editor window is showed normally. How I can debug this plugin by my IntelliJ ? Workspace? I didn’t found documentation only the page on official site but it’s very poor, anyway I’ve already configured the gwt run configuration, and I’m able to start the super dev mode and also to recompile the module , but after this how to start the debugging using some break points on sources?
