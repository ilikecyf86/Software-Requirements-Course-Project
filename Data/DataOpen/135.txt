Reproduction Steps: Launch CHE 6 under docker. *Create workspace from the CHE stack and clone CHE based on master *Build the project with maven Open a class form the current project and Git->Compare with che6 Copy all content from CHE6 section and paste into CHE Save changes Open the just changed file Problem: When i tried copy and paste content from the right section of compare widget (with che6), the copy/paste feature did not work. As clarifed later - the browser was hung. After 5-10 min the browser became avialible. I applied changes from the right section of the comparator. But after opening just edited file the code validator shown all code as invalid. Refreshing browser did not resolve the problem. I stopped the workspace and launch it again. I tried open the test class by Navigate to file. But feature did not work. In the ws console were a lot of exceptions. In java script console of the browser also were exceptions.
