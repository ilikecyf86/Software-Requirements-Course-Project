Download sources for some libs failed
kind/bug team/ide 
steps to reproduce: import git project: https://github.com/codenvy-templates/redhat-kitchensink-webapp.git open org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.controller.MemberController class go to line 55 and go to declaration of FacesMessage class once FacesMessage class will be opened click Download sources expected result: sources will be downloaded and editor will be updated. actual result: Download sources for 'javax.faces.application.FacesMessage' failed More info: After executing command mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=sources in terminal all sources were successfully downloaded and editor was updated. Sources for that jar were in custom maven repo defined in pom.xml     <repositories>
        <repository>
            <releases>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </snapshots>
            <id>jboss-enterprise-maven-repository</id>
            <url>https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/</url>
        </repository>
        <repository>
            <releases>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </snapshots>
            <id>jboss-enterprise-maven-repository-ea</id>
            <url>https://maven.repository.redhat.com/earlyaccess/all/</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
 So it seems that we are not considering custom repos added in pom.xml while downloading sources.
