Description IDE shows agents button (new terminal, ssh info) as soon as the corresponding server is accessible. But these buttons are not shown after workspace stop. As result, during next start of the workspace buttons are visible and looks like the terminal agent is accessible but doesn't work. So it is needed to hide agents button (ssh, terminal) if a server is not accessible. Reproduction Steps OS and version: 6.0.0-M3-SNAPSHOT
