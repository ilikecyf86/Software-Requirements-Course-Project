Do not rewrite editor content in some cases
kind/bug team/ide 
We update editor content on client side when we get event about external changes of file content. But user can have unsaved data at this moment and lost them. So, as new behavior, for case when editor has unsaved data and file is modified externally we can display a dialog and ask user - do we need rewrite unsaved editor content or not.
