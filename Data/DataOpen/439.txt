The logic of generation OpenShift routes and service URLs should be consistent
kind/bug target/branch team/osio 
While using centos_jdk8 stack for spring boot project the following command was created for running the app: After running the command the preview URL has been parsed the following way: http://tomcat8-w10jzvq0dmgbp1it-ibuziuk-che.8a09.starter-us-east-2.openshiftapps.com/ However, this URL points to non-existing route. The correct route URL is: http://tomcat-w10jzvq0dmgbp1it-ibuziuk-che.8a09.starter-us-east-2.openshiftapps.com/ This inconsistency is coupled with the fact that tomcat8 ref is used in the stack's Dockerfile [1] and while creating workspace routes this is not taken into account: [1] https://github.com/eclipse/che-dockerfiles/blob/master/recipes/centos_jdk8/Dockerfile#L23
