Openshift Origin 1.5 || Che 5.20.0 - Snapshots do not contain installed packages
kind/question 
Description I deployed Che 5.20.0 on Openshift Origin 1.5 & have created persistent volumes on nfs server for che-data & claim-che-workspace persistent volume claims. Launch a workspace with default Java stack & console-java-sample project. Make changes to HelloWorld.java class Install vim packages on dev-machine using terminal i.e. sudo apt-get install vim -y Check vim installation using which vim Stop the workspace with snapshot from che dashboard. Issue 1 - Only on Openshift Start the same workspace by hitting "RUN" from workspaces dashboard. On executing which vim on dev machine terminal to check vim installation, It says "Unable to find package vim". Expected Output It should output the path of vim "/usr/bin/vim" Issue 2 - Openshift & Docker Changes done in project files are reflected on workspace restart (with/without snapshot), I believe this is because the changes are synced to NFS Server & workspace containing project files are loaded. The same behaviour is seen in Che running on Docker, as we mount a host volume to /data folder. Expected Output The workspace project folder should be deleted on external volume mounts, so that they can be synced again on workspace restart with changes contained in the snapshot.
