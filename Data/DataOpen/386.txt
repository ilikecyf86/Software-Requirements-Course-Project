Make it possible to configure different WebSocket message receivers in IDE
kind/enhancement team/ide 
Now we have two implementations of WebSockets in IDE: the older one was developed a long time ago mainly for using it in conjunction with everREST; the newer one more flexible and configurable which used now for JSON-RPC messaging. No need for the older impl since we've been removed everREST over WebSocket support from IDE in CHE6. But there's still one place where we need to use a WebScoket connection for raw (non JSON-RPC) messaging. In order to replace it with the newer WebSocket impl we need to be able to configure different implementations of WebSocketMessageReceiver. Because now we have a single implementation of WebSocketMessageReceiver used for transforming a raw web socket message to a JSON-RPC known structure.
