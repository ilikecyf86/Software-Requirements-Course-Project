Workspace Config, minimum memory limit for a machine
kind/enhancement team/plugin 
Hello, When creating a workspace, we can defined all the machines we want. For a mysql machine, I will have somehing like that: ...
"mysql": {
   "attributes": {
       "memoryLimitBytes": 1073741824
   }
}
...
 But for a mysql machine, 1 GB of memory is too much. However it is not possible to put less memory... Will you change this limit ?
