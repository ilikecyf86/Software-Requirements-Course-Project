[CHE 6] Revert renaming of "Agents" by "Installers"
target/che6 kind/task team/platform kind/question kind/task team/platform team/platform kind/task kind/question 
Description For some reasons, "Agents" have been renamed to "Installers" in our model. This nomenclature is unfortunate and must be reverted. The meaning behind "installers" is completely different from end-user point of view. An installer does not provide any features or capabilities - it is just a component that handle the installation of a "software". "Installer" is unfortunated because: On some infrastructures there is nothing which can be installed in a workspace machine(s) Agents might be packaged in the workspace machine(s) Agents can be running as sidecars of the workspace machine(s) "Installers" nomenclature is more confusing than anything for end-users - and very specific to one scenario. Example showing how it is exposed to end-user: Here, the user is supposed to enable features and capabilities provided by "Agents" not "Installers" That renaming also breaks any workspace definition (used in chefile, factories) between che5 and che6: "dev-machine": {
  "installers": [
    "org.eclipse.che.exec",
    "org.eclipse.che.terminal",
    "org.eclipse.che.ws-agent",
    "org.eclipse.che.ssh"
  ],
}
 Here it looks equally unappropriated.
