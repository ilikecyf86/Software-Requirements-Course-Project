kind/task team/production status/open-for-dev 
Description Sometimes we need to have ws-agent's logs to investigate the reasons of selenium tests failures. There are parameters of logging which could be used to setup storing of ws-agents log to the host where the testing Eclipse Che is run: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/che6/assembly/assembly-wsagent-server/src/assembly/setenv.sh#L41 We can also borrow the ws-agent's logs from the workspace container before removal of it and save it into the tests target directory at the end of failed tests execution by the command like the follow: docker exec -it $(docker ps | grep dev-machine | cut -d ' ' -f1) sh -c "cat /home/user/che/ws-agent/logs/archive/$(date +%Y/%m/%d)/catalina.log"
