Cursor doesn't move to next line on Emacs keybinding. Reproduction Steps: Start Che workspace Change keybinding to Emacs. Open Editor. Press Ctrl-P in Editor. the cursor moves to previous line. But the cursor doesn't move. Che version: Nightly OS and version: CoreOS (but may be OS independent) Docker version: 1,11,2 (but may be Docker independent) Che install: Docker (but may be...) In some cases I type Ctrl-P, Che shows list like the attached image. I suspect Ctrl-P is hooked by Che IDE before the editor consumes it. . Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Che: Unknown Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes
