Guides explorer
kind/task status/open-for-dev team/enterprise 
There might be multiple guides provided for a single project and it is important to take that into consideration now as it would impact the end-user experiences. The guides could be accessed when the user is using a "Try it now" button, but they should also be available at any point in time. There could be different guides, for different areas, for "getting started" indeed but there could be guides for more advanced/sophisticated information which the developer will progressively dig in after few hours of work on the technology. The guides could be provided inside of a .che folder as a set of asciidoc/mardown files. As there might be multiple guides provided, we need to mark/indicate which guide will be the default one. We could provide a guides explorer, as a left panel, along with the other explorers that we are providing. This way, we can provided a unified and consistent user experience. Epic: #6150
