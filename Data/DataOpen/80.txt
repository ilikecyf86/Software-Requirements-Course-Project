kind/enhancement status/open-for-dev team/production 
Description Sometimes it is useful to know the current progress of selenium tests executing. For example, it could help to stop test execution in case of significant regression, or if there is too big latency at the product side. As a variant, we can print such statistics in test log at the start of each test: Start of test org.eclipse.che.selenium.miscellaneous.DialogAboutTest#dialogAboutTest
Executed tests: 120
