OpenShift Deploy Scripts Timeout
kind/task team/osio 
When we run the scripts ./deploy_che.sh && ./wait_until_che_is_available.sh && ./replace_stacks.sh the script /wait_until_che_is_available.sh quits half way because of timeout and the replace_stacks.sh never gets fired, though che gets created successfully. Because of that When the user tries to create the workspace the workspace creation always fails with following error Workspace 'che/wksp-84ml' with id 'workspaceqjfsu5mp6j3ehdn9' created by user 'che' 2017-09-03 05:01:03,131[aceSharedPool-5] [WARN ] [.e.c.p.d.m.MachineProviderImpl 564] - Failed to check image che-stacks/vertx availability.
