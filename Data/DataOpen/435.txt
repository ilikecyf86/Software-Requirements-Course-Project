Factory commands cannot run on non dev-machine.
kind/enhancement 
Factory commands cannot run on non dev-machine. Currently I do not want to run the Run gRPC Client command on dev-machine but on client machine. Part of .factory.json: ---
"ide": {
    "onProjectsLoaded": {
      "actions": [
        {
          "properties": {
            "name": "Setup Build-Run gRPC Server"
          },
          "id": "runCommand"
        },
        {
          "properties": {
            "name": "Run gRPC Client",
            "machine": "client"
          },
          "id": "runCommand"
        }
      ]
    }
