From @bmicklea on September 16, 2016 16:23 As a Codenvy Admin I want to be able to set the minimum and maximum workspace RAM allowed when users configure their workspace. This would prevent users from creating overly small or large workspaces from the API or UI. Add a configuration parameter to set lower limit for workspace RAM: limits.user.workspace.min.size which prevents users from creating a workspace with less RAM than the limit defines. Add a configuration parameter to set upper limit for workspace RAM:limits.user.workspace.max.size which prevents users from creating a workspace with more RAM than the limit defines. Enforce this parameter for all workspaces in the system via the API and Dashboard In the UD the RAM slider and the validation on the RAM input text field will respect the values in these two configuration parameters Allow this parameter to be overridden as part of codenvy/codenvy#582 Copied from original issue: codenvy/codenvy#764
