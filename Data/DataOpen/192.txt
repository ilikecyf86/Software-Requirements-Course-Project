Dark theme- the blue text in a css file isn't correctly visible against the black background.
kind/question 
Description I'm using trying to edit a .css file using the dark theme in the editor. However the CSS attributes are in blue color and aren't correctly visible against the theme's dark black background. Could you please change this to some other color or guide me to the file of the theme so that I can edit and push my suggestion. Thanks, Arun
