Che deployment on OpenShift should be as simple as on Docker
kind/epic team/osio Epic Epic 
The epic is about the few small steps that would make the deployment of Che on OpenShift consistent with the deployment on Docker: Add the scripts and doc to run Che on OpenShift redhat-developer/rh-che#284 Adapting default Che runtime stacks to run on OpenShift as unprivileged containers redhat-developer/rh-che#155 Don't abort a workspace bootstrap if SSH agent fails to be started (in an unprivileged container) (redhat-developer/rh-che#346) Extend Che CLI to start Che on OpenShift (redhat-developer/rh-che#418) Inject CHE_* environment variables when bootstrapping Che on OpenShift Adapt Docker image eclipse/che-server (alpine based) to run on OpenShift Package Che as a minishift addon (c.f. minishift/minishift#1264 (comment)) (redhat-developer/rh-che#353)
