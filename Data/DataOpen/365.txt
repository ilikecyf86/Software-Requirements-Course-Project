Preview port and macro expansion for additional servers/services provided via Docker compose
kind/eclipse-che kind/enhancement team/plugin kind/eclipse-che 
From @larrytalley on November 16, 2016 17:28 I have a workspace built with a custom recipe that is a Docker compose file. It creates two "machines", one is "dev-machine", the other is "messagebus". In a command specified on "dev-machine" I want to publish a preview URL for a service exposed on "messagebus". Note that the service is working, and by going to the "operations perspective" and "Servers" tab I can find the URL and successfully access it. But it would be cool if the preview URL worked from commands and published a link to the ephemeral port like I expect. I've been attempting to use the documentation at: https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/commands#macros and I've tried all the permutations in macro documentation. I've tried: http://${server.messagebus.8161}/admin http://${server.messagebus}/admin http://${Server-8161-tcp}/admin <-- not based on docs, but on looking at "operations perspective" Here is my recipe: version: '2'

services:
  messagebus:
