JDT validation does not work on some classes
kind/bug severity/P2 team/ide 
Pasted from https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CHE-208 Working with https://github.com/fabric8-quickstarts/vertx-web and either java-default or vert.x stack, I dont get any validation of test class SimpleWebVerticleTest located in src/test/java/io/vertx/example. Even if I do compilation error, nothing happens. Validation on class src/main/java/io/vertx/example/SimpleWebVerticle works fine, after some time there appear a validation error mark on uncompilable changes. Reproduction Steps: EXEC: Create a new workspace based on vert.x or java-default stack. EXEC: Import a project https://github.com/fabric8-quickstarts/vertx-web EXEC: In test class io.vertx.example.SimpleWebVerticleTest do some uncompilable changes. Wait some time. RESULT: There is no error marker. EXPECTED RESULT: There should be error marker.
