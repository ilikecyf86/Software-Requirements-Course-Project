Suggestions for improved global search
kind/enhancement team/ide 
Description Open for discussion, before I actually start implementing anything. For me, one of the "killer" features of VSCode is its global search (including and excluding specific folders and giving a list of files with snippets). I think if we implement a similar, easy to use search in Eclipse Che it would enhance the usability significantly. I think #5174 already helped a lot, but there are a few things that could be improved: pressing enter in seach dialog should start search directly (right now you need to click or tab to the search button) offering the search panel next to the file explorer (like VSCode), because searching is one of the most important features of an IDE. I had a hard time finding Edit -> Find the first time trying to search. even though ctrl+shift+F sounds like common sense in retrospect, I wouldn't assume that new users will get it on first try Reproduction Steps OS and version: Diagnostics:
