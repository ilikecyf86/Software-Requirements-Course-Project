ANSI coloring support for commands output
kind/question kind/enhancement kind/question 
Instead of outputting the color it outputs the ANSI characters like: Reproduction Steps: Run a workspace running (for example Blank, in my case it was based on codenvy/alpine_jdk8 but in my tests it looks like it's independant of the workspace image) Either run a some commands on in this case in the terminal simply type git log (enter). Note that running ls for example, correctly shows colors. Not sure what is done differently. echo -e "\e[31mHello World\e[0m" also works. The same command ran in the terminal may show colors but if ran from a pre-configured "Command" it'll incorrectly render the ANSI colors. OS and version: 5.7.2 Docker image (I recall this issue also affecting older versions).
