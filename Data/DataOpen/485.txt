Replace everrest based Websocket calls with new RPC framework.
kind/epic 
The goal is to dismiss Everrest mechanism which opens Websocket channel to output long-lived async calls and use new JSON-RPC on top of Websockets instead (the one we currently use for FS Watchers and Exec agent). This should be applied to every side of a triage: client-machine-master. Proposed tactic is following: Add it to the master side and use for IDE-Master connection. The goal - to clean IDE removing Master Message Bus entities and prepare removing Everrest WS (EWS) components from the Master. #4275 - Rework client for Project service in order to avoid using Everrest based Websocket calls - DONE (may be performed in parallel with 1) Do the same for Machine (Agent) - IDE connection, remove Machine Message Bus from IDE (according to priority) #4591 - Switch project importing output to the websocket JSON-RPC API endpoint - DONE #4593 - Switch Debugger functionality to the websocket JSON-RPC API endpoint - DONE #5346 - Rework client for Git service to avoid using Everrest based Websocket calls - DONE #5349 - Rework Java plugin to avoid using Everrest based Websocket calls - DONE #5350 - Rework Maven plugin to avoid using Everrest based Websocket calls - DONE #5351 - Rework Testing plugin to avoid using Everrest based Websocket calls - DONE #5348 - Rework Composer plugin to avoid using Everrest based Websocket calls - DONE #5352 - Rework importing a project while consuming Factory to avoid using Everrest based Websocket calls - 2d - DONE #5522 - Rework Navigate to File feature to avoid using Everrest based Websocket calls - DONE #5523 - Rework Find Usages feature to avoid using Everrest based Websocket calls - DONE #5524 - Rework Language Server plugin to avoid using Everrest based Websocket calls - CANCELLED (depends on 1) Declare EWS mechanism/components as deprecated, apply new implementation for UD - Master connection and remove EWS using there in 4 weeks. #4763 - [dashboard] Use JSON RPC instead websocket requests on master API - ANALYZING (depends on 2) same as 3 for Machine (Ws-Agent). #5358 - [dashboard] Use JSON-RPC instead websocket requests on workspace agent API - ANALYZING Remove EWS from workspace master in SPI branch #5357 - Clean workspace master of EWS - ANALYZING Rework CLI to avoid using Everrest based Websocket calls #5841
