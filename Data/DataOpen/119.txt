Merge tables of ServerConfig objects from installers and machines
kind/task target/che6 team/platform 
Description PR #5876 introduced storing of Installers in the Che DB. In this PR new table for ServerConfig of an Installer object was created, but these are the same ServerConfigs as in MachineConfig and have its own table in the DB. This leads us to the situation when we have 2 places with the same entities and will have to maintain/migrate them in 2 places. So I suggest merging those tables in the DB.
