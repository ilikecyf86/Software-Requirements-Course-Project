Switch IDE LSP stuff to use URIs instead of paths
kind/task severity/P1 target/branch target/che6 
Currently, language server related services use workspace paths (e.g. "/asdf/src/main/java/Foo.Java") instead of URIs like in LSP proper. We are converting those paths to file URI's for use by language servers (e.g. "file://projects/asdf/src/main/Foo.java"). This does not work anymore once we have URI's that represent stuff that is not in the workspace, for example the the class "java.lang.Object". An editor for that class will likely display attached source from a jar in a JDK installation. Currently, stuff like hover documentation, etc. will fail in such an editor, because we cannot convert the path to a file URI. My proposal is to use URIs instead of paths in all LSP related communication between IDE and workspace agent. There are really only two cases to be covered: if the IDE has a workspace path in hand, we prefix it with "chewksp://" to mark it as a che workspace path. In all other cases, we should be dealing with a URI that has been passed to us by a language server, and we pass it on unchanged.
