kind/epic team/ide 
Problem The current Eclipse Che architecture for the client side IDE is using GWT and Guice/Gin for the dependency injection. Eclipse Che IDE is composed of API Core functions and plugins. With GWT, all plugins are statically linked at compile time, it means that adding a plugin to the assembly requires to build each time this build take long time Goals Need to allow developer develop only own plugin and include it to the compiled Che IDE without rebuild all app Make possible develop client-side plugin on pure JavaScript Consider Che plugin as single artifact which contains: server side code; client side code; some meta information; Tasks Investigate ability build each core module and plugin like GWT application (compiled to javascript) and embed them to the web app like ready to go resources Provide JavaScript API for each existing client side API developed with GWT technology with JsType feature #6647 Find way to combine compiled client side code with resources like images and css styles and server side jars to the one artifact. Generate JavaScript template for plugin #7857
