Description Git branches filter doesn't work after click on the dropdown filter. Reproduction Steps 1, Clone some project. 2. Click Git -> Branches... 3. Begin type some existed branch name to activate branch filter. 4. Click on the branch dropdown filter (with items "All", "Local", "Remote"). 5. Try to type some new symbols. Expected: After click on the "dropdown filter" branch name typing should work too. We should bring back focus to the branch list panel. Actual result: typing new symbols for branch name doesn't work. But if you click on the branch list focus come back to the branch list and filter typing works again. OS and version: Fedora 25 Diagnostics: CHE version:
