The performances for opening files operations feel slow and are needing investigation. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B__9XQfR4aFHeE9yaGw0ZGxUejQ There are multiple aspect of the perceived feeling which can be discuss, but as a general statement, see this animated gif, showing what the experience . The feeling is accented by the "steps" or the visual feedback which seems halting/chopped instead of being smooth. When you open a file, user can really see those steps: expand folder loading displayed on folder name folder expanded click on file it opens an empty editor content is added in the editor without syntax coloration syntax coloration is applied Sometime the IDE is also showing the message "Loading file content..." while the file is only having less then 100 of lines. This problem is new, opening files have always been fast and responsive, we needs to chase what are the issues. Note: The same issue is visible on codenvy.io Reproduction Steps: See animated gif. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B__9XQfR4aFHeE9yaGw0ZGxUejQ Happy to try and record any other scenario that could be useful to identify the problem.
