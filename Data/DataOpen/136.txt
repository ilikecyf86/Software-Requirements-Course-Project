Remove deprecated strategy comments from env file
kind/bug severity/P2 target/branch team/platform 
The following in che.env in che6 branch is not true. There is just one way to organize communication between server and agent. # Workspace Address Resolution Strategy
#     The strategy to determine how workspace servers users launch will be exposed. 
#     If the Che server and your workspaces are on different networks that flow through a
#     firewall, those firewalls can prevent communications between Che and workspaces.
#     The default strategy exposes workspaces with the IP of Docker and ephemeral ports.
#     A Docker local strategy uses internal Docker network IP addresses and exposed ports.
#
#     Options:
#       - 'default':      internal address is DOCKER_HOST with ephemeral ports
#       - 'docker-local': internal address is Docker network container address with
#                         exposed ports (not ephemeral)
#     on the same Docker network.
#CHE_DOCKER_SERVER__EVALUATION__STRATEGY=docker-local
 There are other inconsistencies in che.env comments too, mostly related to networking.
