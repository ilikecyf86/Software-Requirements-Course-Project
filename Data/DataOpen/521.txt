Set "expand tabs" according to file type being edited
kind/enhancement 
When editing Makefile, tabs should not automatically be converted to spaces, otherwise Makefiles won't work. However, when editing other files, tabs SHOULD be automatically converted to spaces (depending on user's preferences, of course). Is there a way to set the editor to handle this automatically? Expected behavior: When editing Makefile, tabs are not converted to spaces automatically. When editing other files, tabs are converted to spaces automatically. Observed behavior: The editor does not care what kind of file is currently being edited, it just converts all tabs to spaces (assuming "expand tabs" is currently selected in menu).
