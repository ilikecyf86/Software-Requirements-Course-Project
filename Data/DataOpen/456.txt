Commands Chaining Automator
kind/epic 
Goal The goal of this epic is to allow chaining of commands. A user must be able to define a sequence of commands and make their execution chained: either parallelized or sequentially. The chaining automator script would also have the ability to require new containers to be spined-up in order to parallelized more operations. We should provide the ability for the user to define those chains with a custom editor. The editor could either be based on a form, or better with a visual editor (with a palette and drag&drop capabilities). Sample Use Cases Production Environment replica The environment used for building a project might be different from the environment used to run it. To build and code on a project, there might be dedicated dependencies (aka dev-machine) which are useless in a runtime environment. Parallelized test execution Running selenium test in parallel, on dedicated containers spined-up just for faster execution.
