Create A Factory Based On A Repo
kind/bug 
When we create a factory from a github repo, it fails to pick the .factory.json when the url tend to contain .git. Usually when we copy the URLs from GitHub it ends with .git e.g. https://github.com/kameshsampath/che-boot-demo.git . Because of this the factory create fails and uses the default codenvy/ubuntu_jdk8 image ref che/plugins/plugin-urlfactory/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/plugin/urlfactory/URLFactoryBuilder.java Line 64 in 5b373e6 public FactoryDto createFactory(String jsonFileLocation) { . It will be nice to sanitise the repo url if it ends with .git and use that as jsonFileLocation. Reproduction Steps: Install Che on minishift baed on the instructions https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/setup/openshift/index.html#deploy-che-on-minishift Execute the command http://che-eclipse-che.192.168.64.8.nip.io/f?url=https://github.com/kameshsampath/che-boot-demo.git (modify the che url as per your install) This will fail with the error as the Repo url is not found because of .git in the end Error when starting agent
Unable to start workspace agent. Error when trying to start the workspace agent: Start of environment 'che-boot-demo.git' failed. Error: We detected that a machine exited unexpectedly. This may be caused by a container in interactive mode or a container that requires additional arguments to start. Please check the container recipe.
 Now try the same command like http://che-eclipse-che.192.168.64.8.nip.io/f?url=https://github.com/kameshsampath/che-boot-demo this will work well as the image now will pulled correctly. OS and version: All OS Diagnostics: Minishift install as per https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/setup/openshift/index.html#deploy-che-on-minishift
