Create docker build profile
kind/task 
Che project uses many technologies and programming languages and requires developer to have all of them installed if he/she wants to build the project. Moreover the versions of all the installed tools must match the version supported by the project. These technologies include: java maven nodejs gulp bower golang Some of che subprojects such as exec-agent might depend on linux specific stuff like sys calls - which causes problems like this one. Obviously sometimes we can workaround such problems by skipping build of some of the artifacts, but it doesn't work always. The solution i see is creation of a docker build profile which brings the following benefits: Reduced amount of tools needed to build the project. Well, we still need java, maven and docker but that's all. Tool version switch made easier e.g. if we want to switch golang version from 1.6 to 1.8 we don't need to force user to do that. Better stability, less bugs. Lets say we require build-tool-x v11+, we're using build-tool-x v11 for building the product and on our CI and everything works fine but it turns out that build-tool-x v12 introduces a bug and developers who have it installed might have build issues. The docker profile could help us to cover these topics. @TylerJewell, @benoitf, @skabashnyuk, @riuvshin what do you think about it?
