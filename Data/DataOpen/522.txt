Find command not returning all instances of string in project

I have installed the angular-patternfly-starter project into a Node stack workspace. I have installed dependencies and run the project. When I do a find index.html from within the IDE, it returns 9 results. When I do the following command: grep -rl 'index.html' . | wc it returns 191 files with index.htlm in them. Reproduction Steps: Create Workspace using Node Stack and include angular-patternfly-starter project Install depdendencies run In the terminal, execute grep -rl 'index.html' . | wc This should give you the total number of files that include index.html In the IDE, select Edit-->Find and search for "index.html" with the default scope and filters checked. This returns only 9 occurrences of files with index.html in them. Expected behavior: I expect the find command with default settings should find the same number of occurrences of a given string as a grep -rl '' does from the terminal. Observed behavior: I observed Google Chrome Helper going to 101.5% CPU for about 10 seconds and then returning with only 9 files with index.html whereas grep showed 191 files. Che version: 5.0.0-M7 OS and version: macOS Sierra 10.12.1 Docker version: 1.12.3(13776) Che install: Docker Container Additional information: This is 100% reproducible. I have not tracked it down yet, but having the find window up and closing files seems to hang the browser as well. If I can narrow down a reproducible scenario, I'll file that as well.
