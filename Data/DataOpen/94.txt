update ssh button on IDE for Openshift
kind/task 
The SSH button on the IDE provides information about how to ssh into a workspace. We need to update this information so that when a workspace is running on Openshift it provides information for oc rsh based information. For other infrastructures the information should also check the existence of ssh agent and provide information for enabling the agent if it is not already enabled.
