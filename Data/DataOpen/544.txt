Language Server Protocol: Code Lens
kind/enhancement team/ide 
The code lens request is sent from the client to the server to compute code lenses for a given text document. Changed: in 2.0 the request uses CodeLensParams instead of a single uri. https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/protocol.md#code-lens Code Lens (depends on #5330) A code lens represents a command that should be shown along with source text, like the number of references, a way to run tests, etc.
