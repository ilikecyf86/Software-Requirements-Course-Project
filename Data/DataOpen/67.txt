Navigation in Quick Fix popup between options could confuse
kind/bug 
Description Actually here is two problems with the widget: with keyboard navigation selection could go away from visible part after mouse selection of an option old selection remains Reproduction Steps Keyboard navigation: Open Quick Fix (Alt + Enter) with scroll Click arrow up or arrow down several times in a row Selection is hidden behind top/bottom of popup, but should be always in visible area Selection problem: Open Quick Fix (Alt + Enter) with scroll Click with mouse on an option and then use an arrow to navigate After this, line on which click was performed doesn't highlighted as selected(but actually it is) and after an arrow pressing it redraws, but old selection remains too. Also mouse hover has the same background as current selection. The only way to distinguish is the border from the left, which could be uncomfortable. OS and version: Fedora 25, Che-in-Che, mounted projects & m2
