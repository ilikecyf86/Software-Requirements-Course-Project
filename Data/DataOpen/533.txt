Gradle and Che
kind/question kind/enhancement level/advanced kind/question 
We use Gradle (build system similar yet different than maven) to manage our projects. The main one I'm looking at has 16 sub-modules and 13 source directories. I asked about this at JavaOne last week and was told "che dir" is what I want, and to pose the question here. I've read the documentation on https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/getting-started-chedir but it doesn't appear to address the scenario I'm describing. I also looked at the "Get Started With Java/Maven and Che" page. I tried just cloning one of our projects locally (had to use the commandline because our internal github server requires authentication), building it, and adding it as a project within Che, but I see Che doesn't understand this is a Java project in the same way it does with Maven (source directories, build directories, external dependencies). Are the various dependencies and source directories enumerated in some configuration file that Maven creates, but Gradle doesn't (yet)?
