Cannot successfully create project in workspace via REST API
kind/docs kind/question kind/question 
It doesn't seem to be possible to create a new project using the REST API, using the latest trunk of Che. Reproduction Steps: Browse to the Swagger UI for the Che installation (http://localhost:8080/swagger/#/ if running locally). Create a new workspace - expand the "workspace" heading, then expand [POST] /workspace and enter the following as the body then click the "Try it out!" button: { "environments": { "default": { "machines": { "dev-machine": { "servers": {}, "agents": [ "org.eclipse.che.terminal", "org.eclipse.che.ws-agent", "org.eclipse.che.ssh" ], "attributes": { "memoryLimitBytes": "2147483648" } } }, "recipe": { "location": "eclipse/ubuntu_jdk8", "type": "dockerimage" } } }, "defaultEnv": "default", "name": "test", "description": null, "commands": [], "projects": [], "links": [] } Find the workspace ID in the Response Body, and copy it to the clipboard. It should be close to the top of the response: { "attributes": { "created": "1486958966689" }, "namespace": "che", "temporary": false, "id": "workspacega10o3ag1fxahz1c", "status": "STOPPED", ... Expand [POST] /workspace/{id}/runtime (Start the workspace by the id) and paste the workspace ID into the id parameter, then click "Try it out!". It should return a 200 Response Code. Expand [GET] /workspace/{id}/check (Get state of the workspace agent by the workspace id) and paste the workspace ID into the id parameter, then click "Try it out!". If the workspace is still starting up it should have a "workspaceStatus" value of "STARTING" in the Response Body. Click "Try it out!" every couple of seconds until you have a workspace status of "RUNNING". Expand [POST] /workspace/{id}/project (Adds a new project to the workspace) and once again paste the workspace ID into the id parameter value, and set the value of the body parameter to the following, then click "Try it out!". The response code should be 200: { "name": "eclipse-che", "type": "maven", "description": "Eclipse Che", "path": "/eclipse-che", "source": { "parameters": { "branch": "master", "keepVcs": "true" }, "type": "git", "location": "https://github.com/eclipse/che.git" }, "attributes": {}, "links": [ { } ], "mixins": [ "git" ] } Open the Che dashboard in another browser window. Browse to Workspaces -> click on the "che/test" workspace then click on the "Projects" link at the top. The "eclipse-che" project should be listed. Open the "test" workspace by clicking the link in the left sidebar. The IDE should open, however instead of seeing the "eclipse-che" project in the Project Explorer as expected it simply states "There are no projects".
