Unable to access eclipse/che instance from another machine through proxy
kind/question 
Description Unable to access eclipse/che instance from another machine through proxy Machine 1 IP - 10.187.33.1 docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v ~/che:/data eclipse/che:5.20.1 start --fast Eclipse Che is accessible from localhost:8080 Machine 2 In Browser, access che on http://10.187.33.1:8080 Issue Dashboard shows up, but unable to bring up any workspace. Chrome Devtools -> Network Requests -> you will see there is a GET http://localhost:8080/api which is wrong. localhost should be replaced with the IP address. OS and version: Docker for Mac - 17.09.1-ce Got the same result with latest version (5.21.1) as well. Later I tried the same by changing the following env vars: CHE_HOST=10.187.33.1 CHE_API=http://10.187.33.1:${SERVER_PORT}/wsmaster/api CHE_DOCKER_IP=10.187.33.1 CHE_DOCKER_IP_EXTERNAL=10.187.33.1 CHE_SINGLE_PORT=false And Added the following configuration in NGINX http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    access_log  logs/access.log  main;
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        ''      close;
    }

    sendfile        on;
    #tcp_nopush     on;

    #keepalive_timeout  0;
    keepalive_timeout  65;

    #gzip  on;

    server {
        listen       8000;
        server_name  localhost;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://10.187.33.1:8080;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        }
}
 Expected result Once this is working, I want to ultimately put in NGINX proxy in front of it, so that all the communication goes through the proxy.
