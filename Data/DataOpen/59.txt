Machine tokens become invalid when workspaces are recovered

Description Now machine tokens are stored in memory by workspace server. So after restarting of a workspace server, all machines token become invalid so workspace agent has no ability to request workspace server. It is needed to investigate how is issue can be solved. Possible solutions: there should be a mechanism to provide a new valid token to recovered workspaces; workspace server should persist machine tokens somehow not in memory not to lose them after restarting; declare current MACHINE_TOKEN env var as something like INIT_MACHINE_TOKEN, rework AgentHttpJsonRequestFactory to use the token of the current subject instead of initing machine token, generate new machine token after workspace recovering. The third one is preferable. It is also required to rework a bit generating of machine tokens to make it while token requesting instead of interception of workspace start method.
