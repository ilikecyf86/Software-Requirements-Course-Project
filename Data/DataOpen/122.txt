Use widgets instead of custom actions to show the last ones in status bar

Description In according to issue #7314 there was a need to restore status bar only. But during the work were discovered a few moments that need to be improved: Status Bar uses Action Manager to display the actions on the status panel, see class org.eclipse.che.ide.menu.StatusPanelGroupViewImpl To display the action on the status panel developer need to extends CustomComponentAction to provide custom widget for the action. There were thoughts that it is not logical to display widgets via actions. We can operate directly with widgets. So I propose to create hierarchy of interfaces in api and app to operate with widgets in status bar. User will operate only with interface StatusBarManager to provide custom widgets into status panel.
