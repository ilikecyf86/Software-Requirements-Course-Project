Import & export recipes from/to external infrastructure providers
kind/epic 
Description It is very often that developers start with an external code generation tool, or have an existing application that they want to develop with Che. Currently we have no way to import and existing infrastructure definition and convert it to a workspace. Similarly when we create a workspace we do not provide the tools for exporting an infrastructure definition that can be used to deploy the developed application. This feauture should allow as us to analyze for instance a kubernetes.yml file and present a UI for selecting the bits that should be used as part of the workspace. Similarly we should have an export as kubernetes.yml command that would export the chosen workspace as a kubernetes.yml that could be just applied to a kubernetes cluster to run the application without further editing. In order to accomodate the maintainance of the workspace we may need to enhance our current assets on dashboard for workspace creation and editing and make them accessible within IDE. Top level items Analyze infrastructure file UI to allow selection of desired pieces on workspaces from above analysis export as infrastructure file editor for workspace definiton Open questions Can we continue to sync the changes from imported infrastucture file? Can we quickly iterate on the editing of workspace by showing the effects?
