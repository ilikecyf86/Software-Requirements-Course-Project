Description OpenShift infrastructure does the long operation of creating folders in PVC before performing the async start of a workspace. In such case request of starting a workspace takes a lot of time and dashboard behaves in an unclear way. Performing such logic by OpenShift infrastructure should be moved from "preparing" environment to "starting' runtime. And it will be fixed in the following issue. But anyway Dashboard should handle such cases and disable corresponding buttons, show loaders if a request in is progress.
