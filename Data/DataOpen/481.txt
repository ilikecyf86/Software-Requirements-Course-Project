Server Side Dtos generated in shared langaugeserver.shared Project
status/analyzing kind/enhancement 
When building the project che/wsagent/che-core-api-languageserver-shared, DTO classes for the server side are generated in the project. This is wrong, the classes should be generated in the project che/wsagent/che-core-api-languageserver. The curent situation leads to the availability of classes like gson (which is not available in with gwt) in the ide project for the language server support.
