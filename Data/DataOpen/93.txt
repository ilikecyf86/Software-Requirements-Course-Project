Incorrect behavior of cli for 1.12.6 docker version
kind/bug 
Description I start che6 by command which contains key like -v /some/path/che6:/data and expect creating of workspaces in defined place. But I found created workspaces in /data/workspaces regardless of the specified path. OS and version: Fedora 25 Docker version: 1.12.6 Diagnostics: Looks like it depends on docker version. For example, I have the following output when use docker 1.12.6 bash-4.3# echo $(basename "$(head /proc/1/cgroup || hostname)"); docker-6087f3f148223b41dbd7ba0ccffac21f7f380df6ad8728475e02984fc3ac9464.scope instead of bash-4.3# echo $(basename "$(head /proc/1/cgroup || hostname)"); 6087f3f148223b41dbd7ba0ccffac21f7f380df6ad8728475e02984fc3ac9464 for another docker version
