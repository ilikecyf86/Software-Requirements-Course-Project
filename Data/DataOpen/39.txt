Consider a way to warn users about outdated che.env file entries configured by a user
kind/question 
Description Since we do a lot of changes in Che it happens that some environment variables in che.env file get outdated and doesn't work anymore. A user doesn't know about such changes, so he may be confused that something stopped to work. Sometimes it is tricky to even realize that some setting stopped to work. To provide better UX we may add some mechanism that warns a user about outdates settings and provide a link to a doc where the change is described. A possible solution is to have a file that contains outdated env var keys and message to the user if this env var is found. Then developer that shines down a setting adds an entry to this file and points to a PR or other resource with a description why env var is outdated and how to migrate.
