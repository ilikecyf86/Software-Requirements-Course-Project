HTML preview and extra plugins
kind/enhancement 
May be this goes into plugins but I found some important (to us) HTML features to be missing: Emmet HTML entities encode/decode HTML preview of current file (not the most important if a good Docker server can run in the cloud and expose for example port 8080 but depends when that would be available)
