Add Commands Targets
kind/enhancement 
Goals Commands are applicable to certain contexts, projects and targeted machines. With the work we did with the issue #2681 we have introduced only a part of the context that is related to a single command - only the project. In the current implementation, when the user is in a multi-machine workspace, the user has to select the target machine before the execution of the command is triggered. The goal of this issue, is to allow the user to default the targets of a commands - so that the user is not asked to which machine, the command have to be executed accross. Sub-tasks Allow the user to default the targets of the command in its editors We will handle that exactly the same way as we handle the projects: When no targets defined, we need to continue to show the popup to select the target [ ] When multiple machines are defined as targets, we will show the popup to select the target once execution of the command is requested.
